We cannot determine if there was a temperature change. Carbon Dioxide is created from the reaction of vinegar and baking soda. We knew it was carbon dioxide because the flame went out immediately.","observations2":"The solution changed colors but there was no bubbles and the splint stayed lit because was created oxygen.

","observations6":"There was solid formation at the bottom of the test tube. We made copper and there was a color change the solution turned red-ish. ","observationsEthanol":"there was a cloudy solution","observationsMagnesium":"There was a spark after ignition","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"I came to the conclusion to where I was able to deduce the identity of each gas by table 2 which showed us what happen if a certain gas was present. In test tube 1 the flame went out so it was carbon dioxide. In test tube 2 The flame stayed lit so it was oxygen. In test tube 3 You heard a pop so it was hydrogen. And in test tube 4 the litmus test changed from pink to blue so it was ammonia."}
