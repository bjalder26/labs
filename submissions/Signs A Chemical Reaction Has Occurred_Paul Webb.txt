{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Paul Webb","observations1":"We formed bubbles and it was kind of cloudy but there was no color change. We cannot determine if there was a temperature change. Carbon Dioxide is created from the reaction of vinegar and baking soda.","observations2":"The solution changed colors but there was no bubbles and the splint stayed lit because was created oxygen. ","observations3":"there was a bright light and produced a white-ish powder.","observations4":"The result of the litmus test was that it went from pink to blue. there was no bubbles and couldn't tell if temperature changed.","observations6":"There was solid formation at the bottom of the test tube. We made copper and there was a color change the solution turned red-ish.
