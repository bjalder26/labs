{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Isaiah Ferguson","observations1":"Reaction produced bubbles, the flame of the splint was extinguished upon entry of the test tube.","observations2":"Reaction produced bubbles, the potassium iodide was dissolved and turned into a yellow vapor. The temperature of the test tube rose, and the splint was reignited upon entry of the test tube.","observations3":"Splint was extinguished upon entry of the test tube, gas produced a high pitch squeak, temperature of the test tube rose in the process.","observations4":"Litmus paper turned blue upon exposure to the reaction, ammonium carbonate was dissolved in the process. A strong ammonia-like odor was produced by the reaction.","observations6":"The Zinc turned black when combined with the copper chloride, as a result the solution turned clear. The copper in the solution combined with the Zinc, causing the change in the metal and solutions color.","observationsEthanol":"The fire from the ethanol began to melt the ice in the test tube, as a result water began to build up on the interior of the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"After catching fire, the magnesium burns brightly for a short duration. As the fire extinguishes, the Magnesium becomed ashen and brittle.","GasTT1":"Hydrogen","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
