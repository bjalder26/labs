{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Isaiah Ferguson","observations1":"Reaction produced bubbles, the flame of the splint was extinguished upon entry of the test tube.","observations2":"Reaction produced bubbles, the potassium iodide was dissolved and turned into a yellow vapor. The temperature of the test tube rose, and the splint was reignited upon entry of the test tube.","observations3":"Splint was extinguished upon entry of the test tube, gas produced a high pitch squeak, temperature of the test tube rose in the process.","observations4":"Litmus paper turned blue upon exposure to the reaction, ammonium carbonate was dissolved in the process. A strong ammonia-like odor was produced by the reaction.","observations6":"The Zinc turned black when combined with the copper chloride, as a result the solution turned clear. The copper in the solution combined with the Zinc, causing the change in the metal and solutions color.","observationsEthanol":"The fire from the ethanol began to melt the ice in the test tube, as a result water began to build up on the interior of the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"After catching fire, the magnesium burned brightly for a short duration. As the fire extinguishes, the Magnesium becomes ashen and brittle.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"1. Deduced that the gas was carbon dioxide by the observation of the splint extinguishing as a result of lack of oxygen in the test tube.\n2. Deduced that the gas was oxygen due to the observation of the splint reigniting upon entry of the test tube, due to the increased amount of oxygen present.\n3. Deduced that the gas was hydrogen due to the observation of the gas igniting rapidly and producing a high pitched squeak in the process.\n4. Deduced that the gas produced was ammonia due to the strong odor produced by the reaction."}
