{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Edgar Ramos","observations1":"There were bubbles in the liquid. The color remained the same. and the tempature remained the same. the splint died out meaning carbon dioxide.","observations2":"The mixture formed bubbles. the splint was still lit meaning oxygen. the color changed to yellow. the liquid got a little bit warmer.","observations3":"there where bubbles forming in the liquid. just got opaque but still clear at bottom. the liquid got hotter. the splint caught with the fume making a pop sound.","observations4":"there was no bubbles. and the color did not change it got burned away. the temp change was because of the burner. it smelled like cat pee. the red paper turned blue.","observations6":"the zinc appeared to tun into a solid and sunk to the bottom. the liquid stayed the same but the zinc became black.","observationsEthanol":"the ice melted into a liquid. the flame ignited. the heat and the cold test tube mixed and made condensation. the ice melted and the test tube got hot.","observationsMagnesium":"the magnesium under the flame ignited into a white light. it continued to shine and then when it was extinguished it was white instead of grey.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We where able to identify each gas based on how the lit splint reacted inside of the test tube. The different gases produced different reactions."}
