{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Edgar Ramos","observations1":"There were bubbles in the liquid. The color remained the same. and the tempature remained the same. the splint died out meaning carbon dioxide.","observations2":"The mixture formed bubbles. the splint went out meaning carbon dioxide. the color changed to yellow. the liquid got a little bit warmer.","observations3":"there where bubbles forming in the liquid. just got opaque but still clear at bottom. the liquid got hotter. the splint caught with the fume making a pop sound.","observations4":"there was no bubbles. and the color did not change it got burned away. the temp change was because of the burner. it smelled like cat pee. the red paper turned blue.","observations6":"","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
