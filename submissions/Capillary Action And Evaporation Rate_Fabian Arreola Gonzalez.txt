Even with the higher mass of methanol which would lead to higher London Dispersion forces, the strength of the bonding itself doesn't surpass the hydrogen bonding of the water molecules.","methanolBoatMass":"4.037","methanolAndBoatMass":"11.581","methanolMassBeg":"7.544","methanolAndBoatMassEnd":"10.766","methanolMassEnd":"6.729","methanolPercentRem":"89.19","methanolPercentEvap":"10.81","waterBoatMass":"4.491","waterAndBoatMass":"14.106","waterMassBeg":"9.615","waterAndBoatMassEnd":"14.038","waterMassEnd":"9.547","waterPercentRem":"99.29","waterPercentEvap":"0.7072","egBoatMass":"3.995","egAndBoatMass":"14.307","egMassBeg":"10.312","egAndBoatMassEnd":"14.374","egMassEnd":"10.379","egPercentRem":"100.6","egPercentEvap":"-0.6","vaporStructure":"The methanol evaporated the quickest which makes sense due to it having the weakest intermolecular forces of all three with only having the ability to hydrogen bond once. The one that evaporated the slowest, on the other hand, is the Ethylene Glycol which didn't evaporate at all and instead absorbed moisture from the atmosphere to increase its weight; even then, having the biggest mass and the same amount of hydrogen bonds as water, it's no surprise it's the one that evaporated the least out of all.
