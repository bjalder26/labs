{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Carolyn Bryant","observations1":"buddles, temp stayed the same until the end where it turned cold, the color was clear, after experiment there was condensation, after doing it another time we added more baking soda and it fizzed a lot more going to the top","observations2":"Fizzy bubbles, color turned yellow, temp said the same , more fizzy after heating it, after experiment there was condensation ","observations3":"Bubbles when magnesium was dropped, the parts of the magnesium touching the liquid turned white, there was a pop when exposed to the gas, gradually turned warmer, after experiment there was condensation  ","observations4":"no bubbles, litmus turned blue quickly, no color change, the tube was heated to start the reaction, the smell was made known.","observations6":"the zinc sunk to the bottom, and turned black when introduced to copper ","observationsEthanol":"\nthe ice melted when heat was applied, the top of the tube was hot but the bottom was cold/ warm \n","observationsMagnesium":"when heat was added to the magnesium strip it glow blight white, the strip turned from a dark grey/ blackish color to a white as it cooled off","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"The carbon one extinguished the fire quickly.\nThe oxygen one re lit after we pulled it out of the tube.\nThe hydrogen one popped once we added the stick that had fire.\nThe ammonia one you could smell the difference, and the litmus paper changed quickly.
