{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Kapatrick Fleming","observations1":"There were bubbles in the liquid. The color reamind the same, and the tempature remaind the same, the slint died out meaning carbon dioxide","observations2":"The mixture formed bubbles. The splint went out meaning oxygen. The color changed to yellow. the liquid go a litte bit warmer.","observations3":"there where bubbles in te liquid, the color stayed the same. The liquide got hotter, the splint got mixed with the fumes making a pop sound.","observations4":"There was no bubbles, and the color did not change it got burned away. The temp change was because of the burner. it smelled like cat pee. the red paper truned blue.","observations6":"The zinc appered to trun into a solid and sunk to the bottem. The liquid stayed the same but the zine became black.","observationsEthanol":"The ice melt into a liquid. The flame ignited there was no residue. The ice melted and the test got hot.","observationsMagnesium":"The magnesium under the flame ignited into a white light. It contiuned to shine and then when it was extinguished it was white instead of grey.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
