This causes the ice to float in liquid water.","q14":"The block floats when the mass is very low. Once the block gains mass, it starts to sink relative to its amount of volume.","q15":"Only one of the blocks was able to float out of the four of them. A, C, and D all sank while B floated.","q16":"The only block that shifted in it sinking or not is block B. It does not sink all the way down to the bottom of the water, however it is submerged further down than it was at 5kg.","q17":"A and C are now fully floating once the mass hit 1.80 kg.
