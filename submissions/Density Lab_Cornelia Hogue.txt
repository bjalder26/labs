This causes the ice to float in liquid water.","q14":"The block floats when the mass is very low. Once the block gains mass, it starts to sink relative to its amount of volume.","q15":"Only one of the blocks was able to float out of the four of them. A, C, and D all sank while B floated.","q16":"The only block that shifted in it sinking or not is block B. It does not sink all the way down to the bottom of the water, however it is submerged further down than it was at 5kg.","q17":"A and C are now fully floating once the mass hit 1.80 kg. B remains to float and D remains to sink.","q18":"When adding 2 or more blocks that were normally sinking on top of the floating block, B, it causes all of the blocks to sink. When adding only one block, the floating block withstands it and continues to float (just barely).","q19":"The only way the blocks that sink can float is by placing it on top of block B (floating block).","q20":"The more volume in the block allows the mass to be further distributed among the block, causing it to have a higher density and float. The smaller blocks have less volume for the mass to occupy, creating a higher density and making it sink.","q21":"Blocks A and C sink, while B and D float. This is caused by A (8.00kg) and C (6.00kg) having a larger mass than B (2.00kg) and D (4.00kg). The larger mass creates a higher density in the block, making it sink. Vise versa with the lower mass creating a lower density in the floating blocks.","q22":"At 1.50 L, all blocks A-D sink.","q23":"At 10.0L, all blocks are floating with different floating levels (B floats the highest while A floats the lowest).","q24":"The blocks that normally float sink by adding other blocks with a higher mass. Only one block (C) that previously sinked can float by putting it on top of Block B.","q25":"When the blocks have the same volume, the ones with a lower mass are the ones who float the highest. This is most likely caused by the lower mass creating lower density in the blocks.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.5","den1a":"3.5","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":".40","vol1b":".40","den1b":"1","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5","vol1d":"5","den1d":"1","sub1d":"Water","mass1e":"2.8","vol1e":"2.8","den1e":"1","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"18","vol2a":"1.59","den2a":"11.34","sub2a":"Lead","mass2b":"10.59","vol2b":"4","den2b":"2.64","sub2b":"Glass","mass2c":"2.70","vol2c":"1","den2c":"2.70","sub2c":"Glass","mass2d":"18","vol2d":"4","den2d":"4.5","sub2d":"Titanium","mass2e":"44.80","vol2e":"5","den2e":"8.96","sub2e":"Copper","mass3a":"2.85","vol3a":"2.85","den3a":"1","sub3a":"Water","mass3b":"6","vol3b":"6","den3b":"1","sub3b":"Water","mass3c":"23.4","vol3c":"3","den3c":"7.8","sub3c":"Steel","mass3d":"2","vol3d":"2","den3d":"1","sub3d":"Water","mass3e":"6","vol3e":"6","den3e":"1","sub3e":"Water","q26":"The density of water has to be higher than the density of the object if it were to float. Density is found by dividing mass (kg) and volume (L). The log's overall mass is obviously larger than the pebble; however, its larger volume allows the log's density to be lower than the water's. This allows the log to float. On the other hand, the pebble's much smaller mass and volume causes its density to be larger than water's. This density will make the pebble sink."}
