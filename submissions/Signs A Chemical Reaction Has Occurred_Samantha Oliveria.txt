{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Samantha Oliveria","observations1":"Bubbles when the solid was added. The fire was extinguish when put above the solution ","observations2":"The color immediately changed to yellow. Bubbles and fog formed. The flame relit and got brighter. ","observations3":"Once the solid was added, it bubbled, fogged up, and the temperature rose. Once the flame was added, it made a popping noise.","observations4":"There was condensation on the inside of the test tube and when the paper was held up to it, it changed to purple. It smells like ammonia.","observations6":"The zinc started to deuterate and got darker. The liquid became foggy and into a lighter blue.  ","observationsEthanol":"The temperature rose. The magnesium illuminated upon being inflamed. Thus created smoke and changed the color to white and turned into ash.","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"During the experiment, I observe the impact the chemicals had on one another. From my observations, I used my previous knowledge to make connections to what I saw and used those connections to deduce the identity of each gas from their separate abilities.  "}
