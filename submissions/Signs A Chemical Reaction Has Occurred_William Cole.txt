{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"William Cole","observations1":"The chemical reaction started to bubble with a slight temperature change and the wooden splint went out almost immediately.","observations2":"When the splint went into the tube it bubbled with a hot temperature change, and reignited the ember on the splint.","observations3":"When the lit splint went in to the tube it extinguished the flame with a puff, as well as bubbling and the temperature changed to hot.","observations4":"When holding the test tube over the burner flame it changed the color of the paper and gave off a smell of ammonia.","observations6":"After shaking up the copper chloride and zinc, it changed to a darker color, zinc turned to a dark solid, the zinc in the chloride turned clear.","observationsEthanol":"While holding the test tube over the flame it became foggy, with a temperature change.","observationsMagnesium":"When putting the magnesium strip over the burning flame a bright light occurred along with smoking from the magnesium ribbon.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"By looking at table two chart and in which we observed each chemical reaction produced a different chemical reaction according the the chart in table 2."}
