","p2":"Molecules will still be close together but will move around a bit","p3":"Molecules will be far apart and move around ","q1":"With solid molecules were packed close together as predicted. With liquid molecules were close but moved around a bit as well the motion of the molecules seemed to be in a circular motion. Gas molecules moved freely and were spaced out as predicted but they also seemed to move in circular patterns.","q2":"Kelvin","q3":"The spacing doesnâ€™t seem to change much but the movement of the molecules seemed to speed up. ","q4":"273.15K","q5":"When the molecules are below the melting point they are a bit spaced out. When above melting point molecule move closer together and move more rapidly.","q6":"As a liquid molecules perform the same. Spaced out a bit with slight movement below melting point and when above melting point the move closer together and move more rapidly.","q7":"373.15 K","q8":"Water molecules in liquid state move rapidly the closer you get to boiling point. Once above boiling point water molecules start to move more like a gas. ","q9":"Water molecules move freely and rapidly as a gas. When below boiling point they move closer together, but when a above boiling point they move more rapidly and are more spaced out.","q10":"Argon","q11":"When argon molecules are solid they packed closely together.
