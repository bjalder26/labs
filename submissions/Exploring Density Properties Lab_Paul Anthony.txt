The density of the sea water was higher due to the salt content. I believe the unknown solid was indeed copper due to its orange color and density close to the average density of copper. I believe I correctly identified the unknown liquid because the density was within .01 g/ml of the common density of methanol. the copper percent was not very close to 2.5% as it was 7.25%."}
