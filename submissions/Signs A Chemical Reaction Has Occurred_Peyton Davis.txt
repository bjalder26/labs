{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Peyton Davis","observations1":"It put the flame out and smoked. It also got warm.","observations2":"The test tube smoked out got warmer and continued to light the flame.","observations3":"The test tube caused the flame to go out immediately. It also bubbled. ","observations4":"It smelt horrible and the paper turned blue after the flame.","observations6":"The piece of zinc turned black. Then when shaken the water got cloudy.","observationsEthanol":"The ice began to slowly melt and cause water on the inside and out of the tube.","observationsMagnesium":"It lit up super brightly and started smoking.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"The results gave proof in the reactions that when compared together each one reacted its own way."}
