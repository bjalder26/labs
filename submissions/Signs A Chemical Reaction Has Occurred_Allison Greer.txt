{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Allison Greer","observations1":"When the 2 parts were mixed, there was a \"puff\" and cloud and when the splint was placed in the test tube, the flame went out","observations2":"When the mixtures were mixed and the splint was added, the flame caused bubbles to form and the flame to continue to burn. Along with this there was also color change","observations3":"The mixtures that were mixed created a gas that made a popping sound when heat was added","observations4":"The powder had a slight change in color due to heat and the ammonia created made the base strip turn blue","observations6":"There was no liquid change, but the solid zinc turned black and clumped together","observationsEthanol":"The temperature caused bubbles to form and the water to change color. It also created condensation in the other tube connected","observationsMagnesium":"The magnesium was heated by the bunsen burner, causing sparks and a change in the flames color and a change in light which made it turn into powder","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"There were different gases produced by each test tube. When figuring out what gas came (or was produced from each tube) there were many factors involved. Some such as color changes, temperature change, bubbles produced, gas produced, and smell. Based on each gas, there were different properties shown at each station and experiment. Each gas was identified based on how the chemicals reacted together, what was produced, and what happened during each experiment."}
