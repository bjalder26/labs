{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Summer Fos","observations1":"bubbles formed, pressure built up when covered, put out flame. ","observations2":"Color change to yellow, heat change, reignited ember to flame, produced oxygen.","observations3":"bubbles formed, got hotter, caused a popping sound with splint test, put out flame, produced hydrogen.","observations4":"pungent smell, evaporation of chemical, color change of paper to purple, produced ammonia.","observations6":"color change, zinc somewhat dissolves.","observationsEthanol":"flame from ethanol. condensation forms and ice melted.","observationsMagnesium":"bright white light, lasted for a second and then burned out.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"the flame was put out in the first test tube due to carbon dioxide. The flame was reignited in the second test tube by oxygen because oxygen fuels fire. Hydrogen will cause a pop and thats what happened with the third test tube. The fourth one created ammonia to make the litmus paper change color."}
