{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"ANiya Anderson","q1":"They continue straight and when they colloid with the wall they still continue to go up ","q2":"yes. the difference is once the protons hits the wall it continues in the same direction it was turned to.","q3":"The protons are more likely to turn directions and continue in that direction until it hits something else","q4":"Because the more protons added the less controlled they get?","q5":"yes?","q6":"I am not completely sure, but it looks like the higher the neutrons the more likely they bounce off of the gold","q7":"The particles closes to the nucleus bounces off of the nucleus and those particles make the other particles nearby also curve away from the nucleus.","q8":"It does the same, but there is more of a curve","q9":"The 100 protons start turning once they reach the bottom of the nucleus, but the 20 protons curve when they get close to the side of the nucleus","q10":"straight up","q11":"The difference is, the plum pudding does not curve like the rutherford atoms, they go straight up.","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"Isotopes are the same chemical with the same atomic number and the same number of protons, but different number of neutrons and electrons, as well as different mass numbers.","q15":"an atom is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, an electron is made up of atoms and the number of protons within the atom. isotopes are similar to both atoms and electrons, however, they can differ in electrons and neutron.","q16":"By using the number of protons, you can find the atomic number of an isotope and find the name. By adding the electrons and neutrons you can find the atomic mass of the isotope","q17":"with the name of the element, you can find the atomic number which equals the number of protons and when you add the protons and neutrons you can find the atomic mass.","q18":"With the nature's mix it shows you the full and completed way the atom is made, but in my mx it shows the simple way to make an element, and it also lets me explore mixtures","q19":"","avgsi":"29","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
