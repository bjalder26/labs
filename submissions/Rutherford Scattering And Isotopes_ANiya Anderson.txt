{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"ANiya Anderson","q1":"They continue straight and when they colloid with the wall they still continue to go up ","q2":"yes. the difference is once the protons hits the wall it continues in the same direction it was turned to.","q3":"The protons are more likely to turn directions and continue in that direction until it hits something else","q4":"Because the more protons added the less controlled they get?","q5":"yes?","q6":"I am not completely sure, but it looks like the higher the neutrons the more likely they bounce off of the gold","q7":"The particles closes to the nucleus bounces off of the nucleus and those particles make the other particles nearby also curve away from the nucleus.","q8":"It does the same, but there is more of a curve","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
