{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Jakerria Smith","observations1":"When putting the sodium bicarbonate in the vinegar bubbles formed and the liquid rose to the top and erupted out of the test tube. When putting the lit wood splint, the flame went out immediately. ","observations2":"When we put the potassium iodide in the hydrogen peroxide the mixture turned orange and started to bubble and fizz. When we inserted the wooden splint, it reignited and burned again and the temperature of the test tube rose. ","observations3":"When we put the magnesium ribbon in the hydrochloric acid, the liquid turned white and began to bubble. The temperature of the test tube rose significantly. The magnesium ribbon dissolved. The lit wooden splint popped in the gas produced by the liquid. ","observations4":"When burning the ammonium carbonate, it started to dissolve and release a unpleasent smell. When we put the litmus paper on the top, it turned blue. ","observations6":"The zinc turned redish black while sticking together and the color of the liquid is turning clear. ","observationsEthanol":"The temperature of the test tube rose and the ice inside the test tube melted. Condensation form on the test tube. ","observationsMagnesium":"When we held the magnesium over the flames and it lit, the piece of magnesium turned a bright white color then turned to ash in the watch glass. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were able to identify the gas in the first test tube because the wood splint was flame went out. In the second test tube, the flame reignited. In the third test tube, the temperature of the test tube rose. In the fourth test tube The smell changed and the litmus paper turned blue. "}
