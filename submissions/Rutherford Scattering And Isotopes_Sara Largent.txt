{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Sara Largent","q1":"not a lot of them hit the nucleus, in fact a lot of them barely miss it most of the time. I have only seen a handful hit the nucleus.","q2":"it seems to make them go more diagonal then straight, or like they are randomly swerving.","q3":"They are now hitting the nucleus's a lot more, there is a lot more bouncing around. ","q4":"Because the alpha particles are positively charged so increasing their positivity would mean the closer they get to the nucleus the more they deflect from it.","q5":"No it does not. ","q6":"because they do not affect whether or not it's positively charged or not.","q7":"they are still avoiding it it's just smaller movements. ","q8":"they are a lot more avoidant of the nucleus. ","q9":"at 100, the alpha protons veer away a lot sooner than when they are at 20. 20 its very small movements. ","q10":"it is a straight path.","q11":"in the rutherford experiment i could control the protons which obviously affected how straight it went, but now they are not reacting they are only going straight forward and that is all the movement they are doing.","q12":"Because they discovered that it's like bowling, they just hadn't hit the pins yet. They assumed it was random because of the fact they were not getting much results or movement so it has to be random. ","q13":"because they are positive","q14":"an isotope is an atom of an element that has the same atomic number but a different mass number. This means that isotopes have the same mumber of protons but a different number of neutrons. The number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons, so isotopes also have the same number of electrons.","q15":"an element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains the chemical properties of that element. An isotope is a variation of an atom ofan element that has the same number of protons but different number of neutrons.","q16":"to find the mass and name of an isotope you need to know the number of protons neutrons and","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
