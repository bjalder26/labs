{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Abigail Rogers","observations1":"Smoke was made when the lit splinter was put in the tube. then the flame went out. ","observations2":"When the fire was lit, bubbles formed because oxygen was produced to keep the fire going. The liquid also turned red. ","observations3":"We created what is known as a hydrogen bomb. However, we did not have enough hydrogen to make another. ","observations4":"After heating the test tube and ammonia, the pink strip turned blue because of he ammonia vapor. Because of this reaction, we created a base. ","observations6":"the solid changed color, from silver to black. however, the liquid did not change. ","observationsEthanol":"the lime water changed from clear to milky due to the CO2 released from the burning candle. As a result, there was condensation in the middle glass. ","observationsMagnesium":"The magnesium was heated and produced a spark and then a bright light. After the initial reaction, the solid became a salt. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We could tell the difference in the gases based on the change of color, a show of bubbles or gases, and the extinguishment or continuation of the lit fire.
