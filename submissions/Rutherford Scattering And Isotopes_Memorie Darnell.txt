{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Memorie Darnell","q1":"Most of the alpha particles are shooting up.","q2":"Yes, it seems that the alpha particles are avoiding the nucleus; also it seems that when they hit the nucleus they shoot in opposite directions.","q3":"When more protons were added it seems they that they started to move at a much faster rate and going in several different directions not just up but also to the sides.","q4":"I believe that this occurred because with more protons added to the mix it also added more energy.","q5":"No the alpha particles are still traveling in all directions.","q6":"This because neutrons do not have a charge, they are considered a neutral charge.","q7":"The alpha particles hit the nucleus and bounce off of it.","q8":"The alpha particles completely avoid the nucleus and merge off in opposite directions.","q9":"with 20 protons the alpha particles touch the nucleus and the bounce in the opposite direction. with 100 protons the alpha particles don't even go near the nucleus the shoot up toward it and then fall back down.","q10":"They go straight up","q11":"because with the Rutherford simulation the alpha particles got close to the nucleus and veered off in a different direction","q12":"I think it was because we needed something with more detail so others could understand it better, and because we found out more about atoms.","q13":"because it contains negative charges","q14":"A isotope's mass and proton number will always be the same; to get the mass number it consists of protons and neutrons being added together. The atomic number is the same as the number of protons. The number of electrons is normally the same as the number of protons as well. The neutrons will always be different from the protons number.","q15":"An atom is what builds/makes an element, and an isotope is an element with the same protons and mass number but a different neutrons number","q16":"The mass number would be protons and neutrons added together and to find the name of the isotope you would look at the number of protons and that would be the atomic number.","q17":"you would find the element and its atomic number and add that to the number of neutrons to get the mass.","q18":"My mix has the atomic mass separated out in different containers, while natures mix has the atomic mass together.","q19":"In nature, the chance of finding an isotope of an element is not the same for all elements. According to the percentage chart some elements are higher and lower than others. Also it much more difficult to find to determine an isotope considering the elements are normally all spread out.","avgsi":"29","q21":"Break each isotope down to determine if he is corect.","avgfemass":"55.9349","q22":"the results are very similar.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"I could find this out by test the dirt to find which elements are likely to in it."}
