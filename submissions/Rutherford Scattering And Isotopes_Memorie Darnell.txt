{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Memorie Darnell","q1":"they go straight up and if they get near the nucleus they bounce off","q2":"yes the particles are now coming in faaster and bouncing of the nucleus more","q3":"The speed increased even more and the path of the particles are more unpredictable","q4":"because more pressured was applied to the particles","q5":"Yes their speed slows and the patterns become more predictable","q6":"more pressure pushing them  to slow down","q7":"is they get near it they move in opposite direction","q8":"they will completely avoid the nucleus","q9":"20 protons will bounce off the nucleus, but 100 protons will not even get close to the nucleus","q10":"they are in a straight line","q11":"because in the rutherford simulation the particles bounced of the nucleus","q12":"to see everything more in detail to understand it better","q13":"because it was a negative charge","q14":"The mass number is the atomic number but rounded to the nearest whole number. The atomic number is the number that adds up to the number of protons and neutrons. While electrons are neutral and dont affect the weight of the atom.","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
