{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"David Edwards","observations1":"At first there were many bubbles, but they subsided after a couple seconds. The mixture definitely cooled down some. The flame was extinguished immediately after entering the test tube.","observations2":"there were minimal bubbles after mixing, but it made a fizzing noise and turned yellow. The mixture got warmer, and putting my thumb over the opening increased the pressure inside. The stick bursts into a flame after inserting into the fumes.","observations3":"When adding the magnesium to the HCL it started fizzing, it got hotter, and produced bubbles. When the flame was inserted it made a loud click and put the flame out.","observations4":"After we put it over the fire it turned into a liquid type of airiness, but remained a powder consistency. It emitted a nasty smell, and made the red paper turn blue.","observations6":"The Zinc started shedding its outer layer into the copper fluid after shaking. The liquid and zinc both changed into ashy colors.","observationsEthanol":"After lighting the evaporation dish, it went into flames. When we held the glass over the fire, the ice melted and produced a fog on the gas.","observationsMagnesium":"When we put it to the fire, it caught and immediately produced a bright light. The dish had the same shape but was now very brittle.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
