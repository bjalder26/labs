{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Rhiannon Smith","observations1":"When mixing vinegar and sodium bicarbonate a gas is produced. The solution bubbled vigorously and the test tube felt slightly warm. The flame introduced to the gas product went out immediately.","observations2":"When mixing these chemicals the solution bubbled and turned a cloudy yellow color. The embers on the wood splint reignited. After burning the remaining gas, the liquid in the test tube turned orange and clear. The test tube felt moderately warm after the reaction. ","observations3":"The solution immediately reacted with violent bubbling upon combination. When the flame was introduced the gas combusted with a loud squeak. The tube felt very warm after this reaction.","observations4":"Heating the powder over the flame caused it to produce a pungent gas. The litmus paper turned blue, indicating a basic gas.","observations6":"","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
