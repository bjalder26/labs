They intersection to avoid the nucleus.","q10":"Straight upward","q11":"Ruthford simulation showed single particles and Plum-Pudding there are clusters","q12":"Because he discovered the atomic nucleus","q13":"Aplha particles are positive and the like charges repel each other.","q14":"Isotopes are two or forms of the same element with the same number of protons/electrons and different amounts of neutrons. So the mass number will be different and the atomic number will be the same.
