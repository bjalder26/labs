{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Juanita Childress","q1":"Most of the paths a straight up.","q2":"You have more alpha particles going different directions.","q3":"A lot of intersectioning and chaos with the paths.","q4":"Increased the amount of electrons ","q5":"No.","q6":"Neutrons do not change the element","q7":"The particles move to prevent touching it","q8":"Same thing but more 'aggressively'","q9":"There isn't a pattern in the path for the particles. They intersection to avoid the nucleus.","q10":"Straight upward","q11":"Ruthford simulation showed single particles and Plum-Pudding there are clusters","q12":"Because he discovered the atomic nucleus","q13":"Aplha particles are positive and the like charges repel each other.","q14":"Isotopes are two or forms of the same element with the same number of protons/electrons and different amounts of neutrons. So the mass number will be different and the atomic number will be the same. ","q15":"Contrast: Atoms are the basic unit of elements.\n          Element is a subatnce made of one type of atom; each with same numbers of protons.\n          Isotopes are made up of two or more elements.\nCompare: the same number of protons","q16":"The mass number is equal to the sum of protons and neutrons. The number of protons is the atomic number. Combine the element name with the mass number to identify the isotope","q17":"Find the element on the Periodic table. The atomic number is the number of protons. Add the protons and neutrons for the mass.","q18":"Nature's mix is based on the actual amount of the isotopes present in nature while my mix depends on the user's input of isotopes","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"55.85","q22":"I don't understand this question","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
