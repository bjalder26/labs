{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Jennifer Yee","observations1":"As soon as the vinegar and sodium bicarbonate were mixed, bubbles formed. The splint was lit and once we inserted it into the gas that was formed, it immediately extinguished. The reaction started clear, turned white and went back to clear after the reaction subsided. There were no temperature changes observed. ","observations2":"When the hydrogen peroxide was mixed with potassium iodide bubbles formed immediately. There was also an immediate color change; it turned yellow. The splint was lit and once we exposed it to the gas in the test tube, it started to reignite. I didn't notice any temperature change compared to the temperature at the start of the experiment. ","observations3":"The hydrchloric acid mixed with the magnesium ribon it started to form bubbles immediately. When the splint was exposed to the gas, the flame extinguished and the stick fell apart. The environment was loud, so we didn't hear the pop, but we noticed it visually. There was also a significant temperature change, and no color change.
