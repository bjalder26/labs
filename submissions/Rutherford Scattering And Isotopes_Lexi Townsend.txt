{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Lexi Townsend","q1":"When the number of protons is set to 20 I only a few of them would slightly veer off to their path. The particles did not necessarily move exactly in a straight line but they did move slowly and only a few would get close enough to be pushed off their paths a little bit.  ","q2":"Increasing the proton count to 60, the particles did bump into each other and the the nuclei more than at 20 protons. They were projected off harder and faster than with the simulation set on 20 protons. ","q3":"The change to 100 protons is very different than when I first started at 20 protons. At first, they mainly all went straight through. However, when you change it to 100 protons, you have particles bouncing all the way back and completely off to the sides. ","q4":"I think when you're adding more and more protons that the positive charge in the nucleus gets stronger and stronger, so the positive charges alpha particles don't have to get as close for their paths to be changed. Plus, the more protons the bigger the nucleus, so there is not as much space for them to travel without encountering that force. ","q5":"I think the amount of neutrons does change how the alpha particles travel. ","q6":"Even though neutrons have no charge, the more neutrons you have the heavier that atom is. I played around with the lab for a while and I personally didn't think it was a huge change, but y","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
