","q13":"It is less dense than water.","q14":"Volume has no effect on whether or not it sinks or floats, if the mass is large it'll sink and if it is small it'll float.","q15":"A, C and D all sink while B floats.","q16":"It is the same as before.","q17":"A and C now float.","q18":"Yes, putting A and C on top of B forces it to sink to the bottom.","q19":"No, this can't be done.","q20":"They are made of different materials.","q21":"A and C sink while B and D float. I think this is because of different masses, the lighter ones (2.00 and 4.00) float while the heavier ones (6.00 and 8.00) sink.","q22":"All of the blocks sink to the bottom.","q23":"All of them start floating.","q24":"You can make one that normally floats sink by stacking other blocks on top of it. You can only make one that sinks float by putting one with an especially low volume/mass below it.","q25":"They're made of different materials that weigh differently by volume.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.50","den1a":"3.50","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":".40","vol1b":".40","den1b":"1","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1.00","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5.00","vol1d":"5.00","den1d":"1","sub1d":"Water","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"2.80","den1e":"1","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
