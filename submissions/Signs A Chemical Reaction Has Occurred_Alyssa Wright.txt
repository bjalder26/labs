{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Alyssa Wright","observations1":"There where many small bubbles at the initial mixing. The splint whet of right away. The tube a slitly warmer.","observations2":"There where bubbles. The splint relighted. The substance turned yellow from clear. The tube got warmer after the splint when in.","observations3":"The liquid bubble when in contact with the metal. The splint and gas made a popped. There was no color change. The test tube got really hot.","observations4":"There where no bubbles. The paper turned blue on contact with the gas. The red litmus paper turned blue. The tube and paper got hot. Strong poor order.","observations6":"Half of the solid floated and half sunk to the bottom. The zinc turned black.","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":"We used the splints reaction to the glasses to help identify. We looked for color changes and temperature differences. We smelled for order. We watched for bubbles and gas build up. "}
