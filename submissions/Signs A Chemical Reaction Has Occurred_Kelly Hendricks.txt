{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Kelly Hendricks","observations1":"bubbles began to form. there was no color change. the mixture lowered in temperature due to the endothermic reaction. The burning splint extinguished showing signs of CO2.","observations2":"bubbles began to form. the mixture turned yellow. the temperature increased. there was no color change. The burning splint grew brighter showing signs of oxygen.","observations3":"bubbles began to form. The mixture remained clear. The temperature increased. The burning splint made a pop sound.","observations4":"white vapor formed. the litmus paper turned blue. the temperature increased due to heating. there was a strong scent.","observations6":"the color changed from blue to light grey. a red solid formed at the bottom of the test tube. ","observationsEthanol":"burns blue and orange. there was no residue, but condensation formed of the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"burns white. white powder forms on the watch glass. there are no visible flames.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In test tube 1 the splint extinguished showing the presence of CO2. In test tube 2 the splint grew brighter showing signs of O2. In test tube 3 the splint made a pop noise showing signs of hydrogen. and in test tube 3 the litmus paper turned blue showing signs of ammonia."}
