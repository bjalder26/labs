Not as tightly compacted as a solid. ","p3":"I think the molecules for a gas will look like a bunch of flies flying around. They'll be loosely floating around with no set state.","q1":"All of the molecules are acting like they want to be close with each other, and the spaces just look like little circles.  ","q2":"Kelvin","q3":"They begin to break apart, spinning faster, almost like the gas molecules. ","q4":"273.15K","q5":"The spaces are smaller, and the motion of the water molecules are more active. ","q6":"The spaces are smaller, and they are moving around amongst each other fairly quickly. ","q7":"373.15k","q8":"The molecules are very active, and the little spaces form each time they move but then go away as they're moving below boiling point. \n\nThe molecules are moving even faster as I go above the boiling point. The spaces are somewhat the same, but are getting bigger since the molecules keep moving around.  ","q9":"The molecules of gas are all over the place bouncing off the surface and the spacing is really wide and open.","q10":"Oxygen","q11":"As a solid, oxygen molecules are very tightly compacted, and the spaces are tiny. As a liquid, oxygen molecules are more relaxed looking, but they are moving faster than a solid with more wiggle room for some spaces to open up. Lastly, as a gas, oxygen molecules are floating around everywhere, but not as fast as a water molecule in gas form. ","q12":"","q13":"They were correct.
