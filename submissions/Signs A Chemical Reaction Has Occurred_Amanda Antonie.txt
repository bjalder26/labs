The copper chloride changed from see through to cloudy as well as blue to green from a result from the particles of the zinc.","observationsEthanol":"Condensation formed when flame was lit. The flame from the alcohol lead to ice changing from solid to liquid form which resulted in water vapor. ","observationsMagnesium":"The magnesium caught fire when placed over bunsen burner. This resulted in forming a bright white light and smoke. Color change happened when the magnesium oxidized making it change from grey to white. The more it burned, ash started to come off from it.
