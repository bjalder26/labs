{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Amanda Antonie","observations1":"The vinegar reacted with the baking soda causing bubbles to form. When covered with finger, pressure was formed due to not having oxygen. When the wooden stick fire went into the test tube, the flame went out. ","observations2":"The color of the hydrogen peroxide changed when potassium iodide was added. The wooden stick fire didn't go out all the way when added to the test tube. ","observations3":"The hydrochloric acid began to bubble when the magnesium ribbon was added. When the flame from the wooden stick was added, the frame when out, but it caused a big pop sound. ","observations4":"","observations6":"Zinc changed colors from silver/grey to black. The copper chloride changed from see through to cloudy as well as blue to green from a result from the particles of the zinc.","observationsEthanol":"Condensation formed when flame was lit. The flame from the alcohol lead to ice changing from solid to liquid form which resulted in water vapor. ","observationsMagnesium":"The magnesium caught fire when placed over bunsen burner. This resulted in forming a bright white light and smoke. Color change happened when the magnesium oxidized making it change from grey to white. The more it burned, ash started to come off from it.
