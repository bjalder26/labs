(2.80,2.70)\n4.I believe that we did identify the correct unknown liquid because of how close our calculated was to the actual value. (0.794,0.791)\n5.Our percent copper for our pennies was somewhat close to 2.5% coming in at 5.83%. This could be due to measurement errors while measuring the volume by displacement."}
