{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Andeja Carnegia","q1":"The particles are mostly flying in the same direction, bouncing a nucleus.","q2":"Yes, the particles have no order and are moving around erratically.","q3":"The flow of particles has no particular direction.","q4":"I'm guessing it has something to deal with stability?","q5":"I believe so.","q6":"Well, while viewing this simulation, I haven't seen the AP bounce off the nucleus and then back down into the direction it came from since the beginning. ","q7":"The moving away form the nucleus and into each other","q8":"Now, right before the particles hit the nucleus direction, instead of afterwards, its actively dodging the nucleus ","q9":"I believe at 100 protons the nucleus is being more avoided vs. 20 protons","q10":"Straight upwards path","q11":"One direction vs Rutherford simulation; the particles would scatter instead of going in one straight path like seen here.","q12":"Maybe a charge has been added somewhere","q13":"I'm guessing because of the positive charge of the nucleus.","q14":"Isotope are like family to an elemen","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
