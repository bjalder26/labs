{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Andeja Carnegia","q1":"The particles are mostly flying in the same direction, bouncing a nucleus.","q2":"Yes, the particles have no order and are moving around erratically.","q3":"The flow of particles has no particular direction.","q4":"I'm guessing it has something to deal with stability?","q5":"I believe so.","q6":"Well, while viewing this simulation, I haven't seen the AP bounce off the nucleus and then back down into the direction it came from since the beginning. ","q7":"The moving away form the nucleus and into each other","q8":"Now, right before the particles hit the nucleus direction, instead of afterwards, its actively dodging the nucleus ","q9":"I believe at 100 protons the nucleus is being more avoided vs. 20 protons","q10":"Straight upwards path","q11":"One direction vs Rutherford simulation; the particles would scatter instead of going in one straight path like seen here.","q12":"Maybe a charge has been added somewhere","q13":"I'm guessing because of the positive charge of the nucleus.","q14":"Isotopes are like family to an element, just different mass number or neutrons.  The mass number is what makes the element whole and positive. Atomic number is just simply how many protons and element has. The protons also help identify the element and atomic number. Neutrons are neutral. Electrons are negatively charged. ","q15":"Well the atoms help distinguish what element is which by abundance of protons and the isotopes are the family members of those identified elements by abundance of neutrons. ","q16":"Neutrons + Protons + Mass NUMBER . ISOTOPE NAME would be identified by how many protons are current.","q17":"Atomic of element - number of neutrons = Mass of isotpe.
