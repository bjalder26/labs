{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Trinity Tedford","observations1":"As we were adding the sodium bicarbonate in the test tube full of vinegar, I noticed that there were bubbles forming. There was no color change and no temperature change. We also noticed that when inserting the flame into the test tube of vinegar and sodium bicarbonate it went out. ","observations2":"After adding the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide it quickly turned yellow with the formation of bubbles. As we added the slightly glowing splint and placed it into the test tube it popped and reignited the flame. There was no temperature change. ","observations3":"","observations4":"","observations6":"After observing the cooper (II) chloride and zinc in the test tube, I noticed no solid formation but rather a color change. The color of the cooper (II) chloride changed from a green, to blue, and then completely clear. The zinc went from a light grey to black.  ","observationsEthanol":"As I was observing the test tube the ethanol left no residue, but the ice melted and produced condensation in the test tube. There was a slight change in temperature. Lastly, When I was observing the ethanal I noticed that it is flammable.","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
