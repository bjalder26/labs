H2O has lower mass which also helps it to rise in the tube more than the more viscous methanol.","methanolBoatMass":"3.92","methanolAndBoatMass":"11.56","methanolMassBeg":"7.64","methanolAndBoatMassEnd":"10.633","methanolMassEnd":"6.713","methanolPercentRem":"87.86","methanolPercentEvap":"12.14","waterBoatMass":"3.944","waterAndBoatMass":"13.638","waterMassBeg":"","waterAndBoatMassEnd":"","waterMassEnd":"","waterPercentRem":"","waterPercentEvap":"","egBoatMass":"","egAndBoatMass":"","egMassBeg":"","egAndBoatMassEnd":"","egMassEnd":"","egPercentRem":"","egPercentEvap":"","vaporStructure":""}
