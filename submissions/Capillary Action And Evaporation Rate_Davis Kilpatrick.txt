H2O has lower mass which also helps it to rise in the tube more than the more viscous methanol.","methanolBoatMass":"3.92","methanolAndBoatMass":"11.56","methanolMassBeg":"7.64","methanolAndBoatMassEnd":"10.633","methanolMassEnd":"6.713","methanolPercentRem":"87.86","methanolPercentEvap":"12.14","waterBoatMass":"3.944","waterAndBoatMass":"13.638","waterMassBeg":"9.694","waterAndBoatMassEnd":"13.558","waterMassEnd":"9.614","waterPercentRem":"99.17","waterPercentEvap":"0.83","egBoatMass":"3.778","egAndBoatMass":"14.3","egMassBeg":"10.522","egAndBoatMassEnd":"14.386","egMassEnd":"10.608","egPercentRem":"100.82","egPercentEvap":"-0.82","vaporStructure":"Methanol evaporated the quickest, ethylene glycol evaporated the slowest. Ethylene glycol is a very large molecule compared to methanol or water, while also having the ability to hydrogen bond as strongly as water. These intermolecular forces make it difficult to evaporate under normal circumstances. Methanol has only one hydrogen capable of hydrogen bonding, and is smaller than ethylene glycol. It is larger than water, but has less strong hydrogen bonds so it evaporates faster than water."}
