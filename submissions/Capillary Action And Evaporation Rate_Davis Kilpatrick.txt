H2O has lower mass which also helps it to rise in the tube more than the more viscous methanol.","methanolBoatMass":"","methanolAndBoatMass":"","methanolMassBeg":"","methanolAndBoatMassEnd":"","methanolMassEnd":"","methanolPercentRem":"","methanolPercentEvap":"","waterBoatMass":"","waterAndBoatMass":"","waterMassBeg":"","waterAndBoatMassEnd":"","waterMassEnd":"","waterPercentRem":"","waterPercentEvap":"","egBoatMass":"","egAndBoatMass":"","egMassBeg":"","egAndBoatMassEnd":"","egMassEnd":"","egPercentRem":"","egPercentEvap":"","vaporStructure":""}
