","q1":"When you look at the molecules in the simulation, you can see that the molecules have a vibrating sense of motion, and the spacing of the molecules has holes in the spacing, and none of the molecules are completely touching each other. ","q2":"As you can tell you to add the heat, the temperature scale of Celsius and Kelvin continue to rise. \n","q3":"The motion of the molecules become much more erratic, and they begin to bounce off one another, and they begin to start spinning until they make contact with each other again. The spacing of the molecules is a lot bigger, not creating holes, but creating giant areas of space between each other. ","q4":"The melting/freezing point of water in Kelvin 273K.
