{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Lillien McMullen","observations1":"As soon as the reactants were added together many bubbles were produced along with a lot of pressure. No color or temperature changes were observed. Buring splint went out immediately when it reached the gas.","observations2":"When the reactants were mixed bubbles were produced with no pressure. The clear liquid and white powder produced a bright yellow color with no temperature change. When wood splint was introduced, the stint kept re-igniting.","observations3":"When mixed the reactants produced a lot of heat and bubbles. There was no color change. When burning splint was added there was a tiny popping sound.","observations4":"","observations6":"","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
