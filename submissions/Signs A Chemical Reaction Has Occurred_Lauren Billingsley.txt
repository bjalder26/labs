The liquid turned from a clear blue color to a cloudy greener color.","observationsEthanol":"When the ethanol burned, the flames were orange and hot. As the tube was held over the flames, the ice was supposed to form water vapor on the cold test tube but it didn't work very well. However, it did melt the ice, and water pooled at the bottom of the tube.","observationsMagnesium":"As the magnesium was held over the flame, the magnesium combusted into a bright white spark that lasted about 5 seconds. When it went out in the watch glass, it turned white and left white, powdery residue on the watch glass.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
