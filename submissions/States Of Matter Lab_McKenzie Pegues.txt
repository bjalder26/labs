{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"McKenzie Pegues","p1":"I think solid will stick together. ","p2":"Liquid seems like it will kind of stick together and float around a bit. ","p3":"I know gas will be all over the place.","q1":"The modules don't really seem to be touching. ","q2":"I moved it up 1 time, and it says 167K","q3":"The spacing goes away, and the molecules come together.","q4":"273.15K","q5":"When I raise the heat, the molecules are all over the place. When I lower it, the molecules calm down.","q6":"They're close together, and they're moving together","q7":"373.15K","q8":"The molecules are spinning around like crazy when I add the heat. They're all over the place.","q9":"When water is a gas, the molecules are moving all around. ","q10":"oxygen","q11":"Oxygen as a solid, the molecules stick close together. With liquid, they are still sticking together. Using gas, they float all around. ","q12":"It's kind of the same to me.","q13":"They were correct!","q14":"States of matter are different because of how their particles move, are spaced, and have energy, which depends on temperature. In solids, the particles are close together and only vibrate. In liquids, the particles are more spread out and move around, and in gases, the particles are far apart and move quickly.","q15":"They join the rest of the particles.","q16":"Because it's like their magnetic.","q17":"The particles start going in their own direction, the pressure goes up.","q18":"The temperature has to heat up in order for the pressure increase.","q19":"The pressure continues to go up.","q20":"The pressure goes up even more.","q21":"The lid comes off.","q22":"They go all over the place and out of the container.","q23":"Phase changes happen when heat or pressure makes a substance change its state. In solids, particles are stuck together and barely move. In liquids, particles move around more and are spread out, and in gases, they move really fast and are far apart.\n\n\n\n"}
