The more the pressure built it, the more gaseous it became. After place the lit wood stint in the pressure, I heard a loud pop and the temperature was a little warmer.

The solid (solid zinc) changed from bigger dark silver pieces of solid to black small particles of solids, almost the texture of dirt.","observationsEthanol":"The ethanol burned with a flame after being ignited. The flame from the evaporation dish caused the temperature to become hot. Test tube with ice began to fog when being over flame and the ice began to melt quicker.","observationsMagnesium":"After placing 2cm piece of magnesium into the light flame on the burner, a bright light flashed and made a popping noise. After letting magnesium cool off in watch bowl, I noticed the piece of magnesium turned into a white ash like color.
