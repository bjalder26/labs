{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Brynli Doty","observations1":"In the test tube there were bubbles showing a sign of a chemical reaction.  The splint test made the flame go out immediately.  There was no temperature change.","observations2":"In this test, the mixture bubbled and changed color.  It also made a noise.  In the splint test, the flame took a few seconds to go out.  The temperature stayed the same.","observations3":"There were bubbles but no color change.  There was also a temperature change because the test tube got hotter.  In the splint test, it made a noise as we put the flame in the tube.","observations4":"","observations6":"","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
