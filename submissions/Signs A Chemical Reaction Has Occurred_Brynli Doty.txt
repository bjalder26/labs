{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Brynli Doty","observations1":"In the test tube there were bubbles showing a sign of a chemical reaction.  The splint test made the flame go out immediately.  There was no temperature change.","observations2":"In this test, the mixture bubbled and changed color.  It also made a noise.  In the splint test, the flame relit a few times before going out.  The temperature stayed the same.","observations3":"There were bubbles but no color change.  There was also a temperature change because the test tube got hotter.  In the splint test, it made a noise as we put the flame in the tube.","observations4":"There were no bubbbles.  The litmus paper turned slightly blue, and the scent just smelled strongly of a burn scent.  The temperature did go higher because of the flame.","observations6":"The solid clumped up together,turned black, and sank to the bottom.  The color became lighter.","observationsEthanol":"The ethanol made the outdide of the test tube turn brown almost like it was burning.  The cold ice melted very quickly.","observationsMagnesium":"There was a big flame and light.  The watch glass did get hotter, and there was white residue left over.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In conclusion, each tube had its own gas identity.  In test tube 1, the flame went out immediately meaning it was carbon dioxide.  Test tube 2 was oxygen because  "}
