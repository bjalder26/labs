{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Amberly Turner","observations1":"-formed a cloud, put out the flame\n-the baking soda completely dissolved into a clear liquid","observations2":"-solid potassium iodide, which was white, turned liquid and yellow when the clear hydrogen peroxide was added. The flame went out and turned to smoke, except at the bottom of the stick, where the flame stayed ignited due to the oxygen present that rose up in bubbles.","observations3":"-once flame was added, there was a loud pop\n-had smoke at first\n-bubbled, and continued to bubble long after\n-bubbles made it look a milky color, died down\n-combustion","observations4":"-heated up ammonium carbonate with flame under\n-flame that went in was put out\n-scent changed (like fertilizer)\n-left yellow ring at top","observations6":"-color of zinc went from silver to black\n-the liquid (copper II chloride) lost its blue color","observationsEthanol":"-flames in the candle\n-water vapor is produced\n-liquid turned milky\n-test tube dripped","observationsMagnesium":"-forms magnesium oxide\n-very bright white light\n-heated","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In test tube 1, I was able to tell it was carbon dioxide because it extinguished the flame. \nIn test tube 2, I was able to tell it was oxygen because of the bubbles rising up which caused the flame to remain ignited. \nIn test tube 3, I was able to tell it was hydrogen because of the combustion and loud pop. \nIn test tube 4, I was able to tell it was ammonia because of the smell. The flame was put out."}
