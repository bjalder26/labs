{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Lana Branch","observations1":"There were bubbles when we mixed the vinegar and baking soda. Flame went out when placed in the test tube. temperature did not change. no color change.","observations2":"Yes, lots of bubbles when Splint was placed in the tube. When the hydrogen and potassium iodide were mixed, the substance turned bright yellow. When the splint was placed in the test tube, the flame was relit and the mixture got very hot. ","observations3":"When we mixed the hydrochloric acid and magnesium, the mixture bubbled. ","observations4":"When we placed the ammonium carbonate over the Bunsen burner, the flame turned blue. when we put the litmus paper in the tube, it turned blue and produced a very strong ammonia scent. ","observations6":"When the copper (II) chloride was mixed with the zinc, the zinc turned a very dark color and became more of a rocky substance instead of flaky. ","observationsEthanol":"Yes, there was a temperature change because the ice melted in the test tube. There were orange and blue flames producing light. The product on the test tube was condensation.","observationsMagnesium":"When we paced the splint in the test tube, there was a loud popping sound, and then the mixture got very hot.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were able to deduce the identity of the gases because carbon dioxide is used to put out fires, like in test tube 1, oxygen will ignite them, the hydrogen caused a loud popping noise, nd ammonia because of the strong scent.
