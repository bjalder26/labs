Flame went out when placed in the test tube. temperature did not change. no color change.","observations2":"Yes, lots of bubbles when Splint was placed in the tube. When the hydrogen and potassium iodide was mixed, the substance turned bright yellow. When the splint was placed in the test tube, the flame was relit and the mixture got very hot. ","observations3":"","observations4":"","observations6":"When the copper (II) chloride was mixed with the zinc, the zinc turned a very dark color and became more of a rocky substance instead of flaky. ","observationsEthanol":"Yes, there was a temperature change because the ice melted in the test tube. There were orange and blue flames producing light. The product on the test tube was condensation.","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
