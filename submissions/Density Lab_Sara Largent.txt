{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Sara Largent","q1":"When I increase the mass, it increases the volume as well.","q2":"The block gets bigger","q3":"The water gets higher.","q4":"The mass of the block decreases","q5":"The water goes back down.","q6":"No","q7":"No it does not float","q8":"The volume increases as well","q9":"No","q10":"The mass decreases with the volume.","massice":"5.00","volice":"5.44","denIce":"0.92","q12":"It does not change, the density of ice is always the same","q13":"Solid water's density is 0.92, so that makes it less dense than liquid water which enables it to float. ","q14":"Decreasing the mass on the custom block makes the custom block float. While increasing it makes it sink.","q15":"Block A, depending on how you put it in the water determines if it will sink or float but most of the time it sinks. Block B floats. Block C sinks. And block D sinks as well.","q16":"Now that the mass is at 8.50kg, block a mostly sinks. Block B still floats. Block C sinks. Block D sinks.","q17":"Block A now flats. Block B still floats. Block C floats. Block D still sinks ","q18":"Yes whenever I out block C and D on top of block B, which normally floats, it sinks.","q19":"I put block C on top of Block B so now it is floating on top of Block B.","q20":"Block B has a larger volume which makes its' density lower. ","q21":"Block A sinks, i think it is because it is more dense than the water it is in despite having a large volume. Same with Block C it sunk as well and i think the same thing. Block B and D both floated and they are both the lower volumes of the four. ","q22":"They all sink now","q23":"They are all now floating","q24":"Yes, block b originally floated but once i put block c and d on top it sinks. And also yes, i can put c on top of b and d and it will float with them.","q25":"Because their densities are different.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.50","den1a":"3.51","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":"0.40","vol1b":"0.40","den1b":"1","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1.00","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5.00","vol1d":"5.00","den1d":"1.00","sub1d":"Water","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"2.80","den1e":"1","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"18.00","vol2a":"1.59","den2a":"11.32","sub2a":"Lead","mass2b":"10.80","vol2b":"4.00","den2b":"2.7","sub2b":"Glass","mass2c":"2.70","vol2c":"1.00","den2c":"2.70","sub2c":"Glass","mass2d":"18.00","vol2d":"4.00","den2d":"4.50","sub2d":"Titanium","mass2e":"44.80","vol2e":"5.00","den2e":"8.96","sub2e":"Copper","mass3a":"2.85","vol3a":"2.85","den3a":"1","sub3a":"Water","mass3b":"6.00","vol3b":"6.00","den3b":"1","sub3b":"Water","mass3c":"23.40","vol3c":"3.00","den3c":"7.8","sub3c":"Steel","mass3d":"2.00","vol3d":"2.00","den3d":"1","sub3d":"Water","mass3e":"6.00","vol3e":"6.00","den3e":"1","sub3e":"Water","q26":"The log floated because its density was less than the density of the water. The pebble cank because its density was greater than the density of water. Density is mass divided by volume. The log had a large volume relative to its mass, resulting in a low density. The pebble had a high density because its mass was large compared to its volume."}
