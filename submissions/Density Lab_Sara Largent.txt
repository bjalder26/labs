","q14":"Decreasing the mass on the custom block makes the custom block float. While increasing it makes it sink.","q15":"Block A, depending on how you put it in the water determines if it will sink or float but most of the time it sinks. Block B floats. Block C sinks. And block D sinks as well.","q16":"Now that the mass is at 8.50kg, block a mostly sinks. Block B still floats. Block C sinks.
