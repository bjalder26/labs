{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Sara Largent","q1":"When I increase the mass, it increases the volume as well.","q2":"The block gets bigger","q3":"The water gets higher.","q4":"The mass of the block decreases","q5":"The water goes back down.","q6":"No","q7":"No it does not float","q8":"The volume increases as well","q9":"No","q10":"The mass decreases with the volume.","massice":"5.00","volice":"5.44","denIce":"0.92","q12":"It does not change, the density of ice is always the same","q13":"Solid water's density is 0.92, so that makes it less dense than liquid water which enables it to float. ","q14":"Decreasing the mass on the custom block makes the custom block float. While increasing it makes it sink.","q15":"Block A, depending on how you put it in the water determines if it will sink or float but most of the time it sinks. Block B floats. Block C sinks. And block D sinks as well.","q16":"Now that the mass is at 8.50kg, block a mostly sinks. Block B still floats. Block C sinks. Block D sinks.","q17":"Block A now flats. Block B still floats. Block C floats. Block D still sinks ","q18":"Yes whenever I out block C and D on top of block B, which normally floats, it sinks.","q19":"I put block C on top of Block B so now it is floating on top of Block B.","q20":"Block B has a larger volume which makes its' density lower. ","q21":"Block A sinks, i think it is because it is more dense than the water it is in despite having a large volume. Same with Block C it sunk as well and i think the same thing. Block B and D both floated and they are both the lower volumes of the four. ","q22":"They all sink now","q23":"They are all now floating","q24":"Yes, block b originally floated but once i put block c and d on top it sinks. And also yes, i can put c on top of b and d and it will float with them.","q25":"Because their densities are different.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"","den1a":"5.50","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
