{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Sarah Smith","q1":"It travels undeflected through the atom.","q2":"It changes how the partials move. Like for example curving and bouncing around. ","q3":"They bounce and bend way more than before.","q4":"Because they are being deflected at larger angles. ","q5":"Yes slightly.","q6":"They are moving faster than before.","q7":"Most pass through the foil.","q8":"Most pass through but some are now being deflected and bending slightly.","q9":"They deflect at larger angles than the original. ","q10":"Curved paths.","q11":"Rutherford believed it to be like how planets orbit, unlike this where they are in like a soup.","q12":"Because of the discovery of the atomic nucleus. ","q13":"They are both positively charged so they repel each other. ","q14":"atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different number of neutrons","q15":"Protons and electrons can be the same but its just the number of neutrons that matter in this case.","q16":"The sum of protons and neutrons is the mass.","q17":"Add protons to neutrons to find the mass number.
