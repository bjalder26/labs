{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Cornelia Hogue","q1":"At 20 protons, the alpha particles are moving mostly upwards in a mostly straight line.","q2":"At 60 protons, most of them are still going upwards in a straight motion; however, there are some alpha particles being reflected off of the nucleus.","q3":"At 100 protons, the alpha particles are moving in all types of directions, opposed to most of them traveling upwards at the beginning.","q4":"The increase of alpha particles are generating a more repulsive charge to the positive nucleus.","q5":"Adding and subtracting neutrons made no distinctive difference to how the alpha particles traveled.","q6":"Due to the lack of negative or positive charge from the neutron, causing there to be no difference in attraction or repulsion from the alpha particles.","q7":"The alpha particles avoid the nucleus by repelling off of it.","q8":"The alpha particles are avoiding the nucleus, however they are reflecting away from the nucleus at a further distance.","q9":"As the protons increase, the distance from the nucleus and the alpha particles increase as the particles repel off of it.","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
