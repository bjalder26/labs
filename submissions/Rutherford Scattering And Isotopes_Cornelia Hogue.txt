{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Cornelia Hogue","q1":"At 20 protons, the alpha particles are moving mostly upwards in a mostly straight line.","q2":"At 60 protons, most of them are still going upwards in a straight motion; however, there are some alpha particles being reflected off of the nucleus.","q3":"At 100 protons, the alpha particles are moving in all types of directions, opposed to most of them traveling upwards at the beginning.","q4":"The increase of alpha particles are generating a more repulsive charge to the positive nucleus.","q5":"Adding and subtracting neutrons made no distinctive difference to how the alpha particles traveled.","q6":"Due to the lack of negative or positive charge from the neutron, causing there to be no difference in attraction or repulsion from the alpha particles.","q7":"The alpha particles avoid the nucleus by repelling off of it.","q8":"The alpha particles are avoiding the nucleus, however they are reflecting away from the nucleus at a further distance.","q9":"As the protons increase, the distance from the nucleus and the alpha particles increase as the particles repel off of it.","q10":"The alpha particles travel past the model in a straight motion.","q11":"Even with the presence of the positive charge, the alpha particles continue to travel in a straight line.","q12":"Rutherford's pudding model created a positive charge that is more spread out rather than it being only in a condensed form.","q13":"The Alpha particles contained a positive charge, causing it to not be attracted to the positive nucleus.","q14":"An isotope is a form of an element containing the same number of protons and electrons but carrying different numbers of neutrons. Isotopes of one element can all be found to all h","q15":"Elements, atoms, and isotopes can all be identified based on their number of protons. However, with isotopes, there can be found different number of neutrons, causing there to be a difference in mass. ","q16":"The mass of an isotope can be found by adding the number of protons and electrons. The name can be found primarily by the number of protons, and putting the mass number besides the element's name with a dash.","q17":"Using the name of an element, you can find the mass of an isotope by reading the atomic number besides the name, and adding that to the number of neutrons.","q18":"My Mix displays an artificial view of elements and their isotopes. Nature's Mix displays the natural distribution of elements and their isotopes' abundance.","q19":"In nature, the probability or chance of finding one isotope of an element is not the same for all elements. This is due to the different chances of neutrons being gained or lost in different elements. The simulation shows elements and their isotope's abundance being different for each element. Some elements only have one isotope, while others such as Silicon has three.","avgsi":"29","q21":"One way Bill can check if his ideas are correct by looking at the simulation to see the abundance of each isotope. In the simulation, Silicon-28 is far more abundant than Silicon-29 and Silicon-30, further inciting the low chance that the rock could have equal parts of each isotope.","avgfemass":"54.83","q22":"My results are quite similar to Iron's amu on the periodic table, it lacks .01 amu, making Iron's amu on the periodic table 54.84.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"The likeliness of the combination being found in dirt is low due to the lack of Nitrogen-15 in Nature's Mix, causing it to be most likely Nitrogen-14 that is found in the dirt."}
