{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Braden Brooks","p1":"the molecules will be stuck together or packed closely.","p2":"Spread out more and moving but still maintaining a shape.","p3":"They will be very spread out and moving rapidly.","q1":"They are vibrating but still in one shape.","q2":"Its showing 362 K.","q3":"The molecules collapse and space out. ","q4":"180 K is the melting and freezing point.","q5":"Below the melting point, the water stays stuck together but as soon as the melting point is reached the water starts to separate. ","q6":"The molecules are moving slowly and close together.","q7":"370 K is the boiling point.","q8":"Below the boiling point, all the molecules are at the bottom close together and above the the point the molecules start to float away and move faster.","q9":"They are very spaced and are taking up the space more.","q10":"Oxygen ","q11":"As a solid the particles are together in a block, as a liquid they are in a big ball not moving very much, and as a gas they are moving fast and everywhere. ","q12":"Its similar in how each state of matter changes the shape the particles take up and its different because liquid oxygen is still very solid-like compared to water. ","q13":"They were incorrect as liquid oxygen was not moving like I thought it would.","q14":"They are different in the amount of temperature required to change them and the amount of spacing with each state. ","q15":"It rises.","q16":"They combine and are atterrated to each other.","q17":"The particles move a lot and the pressure rises a lot.","q18":"The temperature rises and the state turns to a gas.","q19":"It continues to rise.","q20":"I builds rapidly because there is not enough space for the particles. ","q21":"The lid pops open.","q22":"they fly out of the container.","q23":"Temperature rising increase pressure and makes the particles move more, taking up more space."}
