The Gas from reaction put the fire on the splint out.","observations2":"Bubbled in the beginning. Wooden splint sparkled and popped. Color changed to dark yellow. There was no temperature change.","observations3":"The substance bubbled, no color change, remained clear, Splint popped, and flame went out. The test tube got warm.","observations4":"Ammonium carbonate turned black and smell changed from no odor to pungent odor.","observations6":"We mixed zinc and copper chloride to change into a solution. The color change was silver to black.","observationsEthanol":"Test tube still cold. Ice melted, precipitation on outside of the tube.","observationsMagnesium":"Magnesium turned bright. Seem to have reach a certain temperature to combustion. The residue was sticky.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
