{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Barry Brown","observations1":"Bubbles formed in the beginning. The Gas from reaction put the fire on the splint out.","observations2":"Bubbled in the beginning. Wooden splint sparkled and popped. Color changed to dark yellow. There was no temperature change.","observations3":"The substance bubbled, no color change, remained clear, Splint popped, and flame went out. The test tube got warm.","observations4":"Ammonium carbonate turned black, and smell changed from no odor to pungent odor. Changed color of paper from pinkish red to blue.","observations6":"We mixed zinc and copper chloride to change into a solution. The color change was silver to black.","observationsEthanol":"Test tube still cold. Ice melted, precipitation on outside of the tube.","observationsMagnesium":"Magnesium turned bright. Seem to have reach a certain temperature to combustion. The residue was sticky.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In test tube one carbon dioxide put the fire out on the flint.\nIn test tube two the splint popped, and flame remained. When fire is exposed to oxygen the grows.\nIn test tube three hydrogen bubbled and made sparks.\nIn test tube four Ammonia changed color from mixing the zinc to make blue."}
