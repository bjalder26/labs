Density is the ratio of mass to volume expressed as (density = mass/volume), therefore objects with densities less than water will float whereas those with higher densities will sink. Of course, even though the log has a bigger mass than the pebble, it beats it to have a bigger volume that will dilute its density. By observing, the log's density is less than water, so it can stay at the top of the water. On the other hand, the pebble has both low gloss plus high mass which contributes to its higher density than water thus it sinks."}
