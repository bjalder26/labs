Its particles vibrate around fixed axes is why the molecules are jumping around. ","q2":"Kelvins","q3":"There is no space between the water molecules. The molecules form into a puddle as the temperature increases.

When it was above melting point, the molecules where still and in a puddle. ","q6":"They are all moving/vibrating around in a puddle at the bottom. ","q7":"373.15 Kelvins","q8":"Above its boiling point, some of the molecules are flying around and move around the container while some still stay at the bottom of the container. Below boiling point, the molecules are falling back down to the bottom of the container and returning to a liquid. I think it turns into some gas particles when its above the boiling point.
