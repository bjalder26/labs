The simulation shows that the probability of finding a specific isotope of an element varies depending on the element. For example, Silicon-28 is the most abundant isotope of silicon, while Silicon-29 and Silicon-30 are less abundant. This indicates that the probability of finding each isotope is not the same. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the simulation. \n","avgsi":"29","q21":"Compare this calculated average mass with the actual average mass of silicon in the rock to check if bill’s idea is correct.","avgfemass":"55.638","q22":"The average mass of iron calculated is very close to the atomic mass of iron on the periodic table.","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
