","p3":"I think the molecules for gas will be spread apart and moving around.","q1":"The molecules are close together with a little bit of space. There are some holes between some of the molecules. They are moving around but not very much they are vibrating. ","q2":"When I add heat the thermometer is at 352K.","q3":"They are moving around a lot more and moving in circular motions a lot faster, and the molecules are closer together. ","q4":"The melting point in kelvin is 273.","q5":"When the temperature is below melting point the molecules are vibrating closely together witha little space. When the temperature is above melting point the molecules are moving faster in circular motions with little to no space between them at all.","q6":"When water is a liquid the molecules are moving fast some are moving in circles and some are vibrating, and they are really close together.
