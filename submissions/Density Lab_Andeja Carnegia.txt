Density, on the other hand, is defined as the mass of an object per unit volume.\n\nThe log had a larger mass and volume compared to the pebble. In turn, the log has a lower density because the mass is spread over a larger volume. This is the opposite for the pebble, making it higher in density. Lower densities create  buoyancy and can allow things to float. Opposed to the pebble, objects with higher densities, such as the pebble, are not buoyant and sink "}
