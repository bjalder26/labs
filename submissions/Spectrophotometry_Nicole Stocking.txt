The tubes were well-cleaned before being placed in the spectrophotometer. Lastly, we read the absorbance number as soon as the tube was placed in the spectrophotometer.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"Orange","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"Green","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"Purple/Pink","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"Yellow","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"Red","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"Orange","colorUnknownCobalt":"Pink","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
