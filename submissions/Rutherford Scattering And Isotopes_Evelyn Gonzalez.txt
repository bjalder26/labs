{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Evelyn Gonzalez","q1":"They only go towards one direction and don't scatter as much","q2":"Yes, they scatter and move towards different directions. They're also a little bit faster.","q3":"This increase causes the alpha particles to go very fast. When I first started, they moved really slow and only towards one direction. Now, they go towards every direction.","q4":"I think this change happens because the alpha particles get a positive force from the protons. ","q5":"Yes, it does change the way Alpha particles travel.","q6":"Neutrons causes the nucleus to have overall stability. A change in the number of neutrons can cause changes within the nucleus and how alpha particles move.","q7":"They look like they split up in half and go towards opposite directions. ","q8":"They also go towards opposite directions but faster. ","q9":"The 20 protons go towards the top and with 100 protons, they go really low towards the bottom.
