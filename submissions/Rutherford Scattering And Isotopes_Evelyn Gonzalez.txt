{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Evelyn Gonzalez","q1":"They only go towards one direction and don't scatter as much","q2":"Yes, they scatter and move towards different directions. They're also a little bit faster.","q3":"This increase causes the alpha particles to go very fast. When I first started, they moved really slow and only towards one direction. Now, they go towards every direction.","q4":"I think this change happens because the alpha particles get a positive force from the protons.
