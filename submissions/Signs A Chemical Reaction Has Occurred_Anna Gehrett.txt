{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Anna Gehrett","observations1":"There were bubbles when I added the solid. The flame was extinguished when put above the solution. ","observations2":"The color immediately changed to yellow. Bubbles formed and got foggy. The flame relit and got brighter.","observations3":"Once the solid was added, it bubbled, fogged up, and the temperature rose. Once the flame was added and my finger was taken off the top, it made a pop noise.","observations4":"There was condensation on the inside of the test tube and when the paper was held up to it, it changed to purple. It smells like ammonia. ","observations6":"The zinc deteriorated and got darker. The color of the liquid got lighter and foggy.","observationsEthanol":"The flame got hot and caused condensation to form on the outside of the test tube. The ice melted due to the heat.","observationsMagnesium":"The temperature rose. The magnesium illuminated upon being inflamed. This created smoke and changed the color to white and turned into ash.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"During the experiment, I observed the changes closely and used my previous knowledge of the effects certain chemicals will have when introduced with a flame. I noticed temperature, color, and odor changes."}
