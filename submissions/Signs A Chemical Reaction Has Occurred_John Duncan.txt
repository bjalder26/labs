{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"John Duncan","observations1":"No bubbles. A gas was produced by the split test. Cloudy gas.","observations2":"Color changed from yellow to dark orange and bubbles were created from the splint test.","observations3":"Made a hydrogen bomb from the split test. Sound was created.","observations4":"The color of the paper changed from red to blue when heated. Could smell ammomia","observations6":"Liquid reacts to solid. Zinc turned blacked and broke down into many small pieces.","observationsEthanol":"The lime water changed to a milky white because of the carbon dioxide released from the burning candle. Condensation occurred in the cold test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"The use of the Brunson burner caused temperature change. White light was produced. Color of magisum turned white. Soft white residues were produced.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"1.  Because of the smoke that was created .\n2. Because of the bubbles that were created.\n3. From the sound that was created.\n4. Because of the smell and the color the paper changed."}
