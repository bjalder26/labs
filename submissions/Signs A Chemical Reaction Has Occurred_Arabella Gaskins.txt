The wooden splint went out immediately indicating that the gas emitted is carbon dioxide.","observations2":"Bubbles formed and color changed immediately to a dark yellow. There was no change in temperature. The wooden splint went out immediately indicating that the gas emitted is carbon dioxide.","observations3":"Bubbles formed, but not as aggressively as previous reactions. The tube felt very hot to the touch. The splint went out once again indicating the gas emitted is carbon dioxide.","observations4":"","observations6":"It appears that the copper chloride diluted in color a small amount, but it is obvious the zinc changed color and became a lot darker.
