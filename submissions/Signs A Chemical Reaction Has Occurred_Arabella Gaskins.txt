{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Arabella Gaskins","observations1":"Bubbles formed immediately. There was no change in temperature or color. The wooden splint went out immediately indicating that the gas emitted is carbon dioxide.","observations2":"Bubbles formed and color changed immediately to a dark yellow. There was no change in temperature. The wooden splint went out immediately indicating that the gas emitted is carbon dioxide.","observations3":"Bubbles formed, but not as aggressively as previous reactions. The tube felt very hot to the touch. The splint went out once again indicating the gas emitted is carbon dioxide.","observations4":"The burning of the ammonia caused the emission of a terribly string scent. It was pungent and distinct. The litmus paper turned blue when held above the tube.","observations6":"It appears that the copper chloride diluted in color a small amount, but it is obvious the zinc changed color and became a lot darker. No other observations.","observationsEthanol":"The alcohol itself caught on fire and evaporated. The ice inside the tube melted and a lot of condensation formed on the outside. The color of the glass changed as it came too close to the flames. Needless to say, the entire test tube got hot.","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
