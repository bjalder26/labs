{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Arabella Gaskins","observations1":"Bubbles formed immediately. There was no change in temperature or color. The wooden splint went out immediately indicating that the gas emitted is carbon dioxide.","observations2":"Bubbles formed and color changed immediately to a dark yellow. There was no change in temperature. The splint ignited indicating that the gas emitted is oxygen.","observations3":"Bubbles formed, but not as aggressively as previous reactions. The tube felt very hot to the touch. The splint \"popped\" indicating that the gas emitted is hydrogen.","observations4":"The burning of the ammonia caused the emission of a terribly string scent. It was pungent and distinct. The litmus paper turned blue when held above the tube.","observations6":"It appears that the copper chloride diluted in color a small amount, but it is obvious the zinc changed color and became a lot darker. No other observations.","observationsEthanol":"The alcohol itself caught on fire and evaporated. The ice inside the tube melted and a lot of condensation formed on the outside. The color of the glass changed as it came too close to the flames. Needless to say, the entire test tube got hot.","observationsMagnesium":"Initially, it appeared like it was about to melt while also emitting orange flames. Almost instantaneously, it sparked suddenly and it was a white color. After it finished, the magnesium turned to brittle ash.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"I was able to deduct that by remembering the case rules, where certain happenings to the splint or litmus paper can indicate the release of certain gases, but also by evaluating the chemical equations. Nothing new appears or disappears in a reaction, it is only rearranged."}
