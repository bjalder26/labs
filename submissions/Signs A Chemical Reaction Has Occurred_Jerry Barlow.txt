{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Jerry Barlow","observations1":"some bubbles and the splint fire was put out temp went down because the flame was put out","observations2":"some bubble turned yellow splint burned brighter and because the fire got bigger the temp went up","observations3":"some bubbles splint caused a pop and the mixture turned a milky white","observations4":"did not see any bubbles the litmus test turned blue and it smelled like pool water.","observations6":"zinc turned from silver in color to black.","observationsEthanol":"you could feel the heat from the fire and see the light it produced. you could also see some condensation on the outside of the test tube","observationsMagnesium":"bright light from the magnesium a small flame and some white residue was left over.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"the gases cause a different reaction when the splint was put inside of the test tube. how the flame on the splint reacted was how i was able to tell the type of gas that was produced."}
