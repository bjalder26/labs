{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Simon Brock","observations1":"Bubbles formed in the vinegar and it got colder. The fire in the splint got extinguished immediately when put in the test tube.","observations2":"Bubbles formed and the liquid turned to an orange color. The temperature got hot as soon as the splint entered. The splint got reignited again after being extinguished.","observations3":"Bubbles formed in the liquid. The splint got extinguished when it entered the tube and the liquid made a pop noise. The solid turned into a white color. The temperature got hot.","observations4":"No bubbles. The litmus paper turned blue when it went into the tube. The temperature got hot and made the solid smell like cleaning product.","observations6":"The zinc got smaller and changed to a darker color. Over time, it changes to a red color and sheds. The liquid gets cloudier. ","observationsEthanol":"The ice melted and condensation formed at the bottom of the test tube. The ethanol turned into flames and went out after a short time. Some of the ethanol didn't burn.","observationsMagnesium":"It got really hot and bright. The light was bright enough to light up the whole station. It burst into flames and changed white after the flames went away. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"The reaction from each test tube and what it did to the splint explained what the gases were. Along with the scents and the temperature change. Test tube 1 made the splint get extinguished which is a property of carbon dioxide. Test tube 2 made the splint get reignited which is what oxygen does to fire. Test tube 3 made a pop noise along with changing the solid and test tube 4 had a smell of ammonia to it."}
