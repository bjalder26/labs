The fire in the splint got extinguished immediately when put in the test tube.","observations2":"Bubbles formed and the liquid turned to an orange color. The temperature got hot as soon as the splint entered. The splint got reignited again after being extinguished.","observations3":"","observations4":"","observations6":"The zinc got smaller and changed to a darker color. Over time, it changes to a red color and sheds. The liquid gets cloudier. ","observationsEthanol":"The ice melted and condensation formed at the bottom of the test tube. The ethanol turned into flames and went out after a short time. Some of the ethanol didn't burn.","observationsMagnesium":"It got really hot and bright. The light was bright enough to light up the whole station. It burst into flames and changed white after the flames went away.
