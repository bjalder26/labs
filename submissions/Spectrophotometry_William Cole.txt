We also got the exact values from the spectrophotometer. Wiping off the test tubes before putting them in the spectrophotometer also gave us an accurate answer.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"yellow","colorUnknownCobalt":"violent","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
