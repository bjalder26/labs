{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Ruby Beth Barton","q1":"The path of the alpha particles when the number of protons is set to 20 is away from the nucleus. All of the particle's paths are avoiding or bouncing off of the nucleus and going straight up. ","q2":"When the number of protons is increased to 60, the paths become less consistent, and they begin to go horizontally and not just straight up. The paths still bounce off of the nucleus, but some bounce off and change direction in their paths. ","q3":"The paths of the alpha particles are a lot more varied and not uniform like the paths were in the beginning. All amounts of protons still bounce off of the nucleus but in the 60 and 100 amounts, the contact changed the direction of their paths.
