{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Ruby Beth Barton","q1":"The path of the alpha particles when the number of protons is set to 20 is away from the nucleus. All of the particle's paths are avoiding or bouncing off of the nucleus and going straight up. ","q2":"When the number of protons is increased to 60, the paths become less consistent, and they begin to go horizontally and not just straight up. The paths still bounce off of the nucleus, but some bounce off and change direction in their paths. ","q3":"The paths of the alpha particles are a lot more varied and not uniform like the paths were in the beginning. All amounts of protons still bounce off of the nucleus but in the 60 and 100 amounts, the contact changed the direction of their paths. ","q4":"I think this changed occurred because when the atom had a greater number of protons, the more mass the atom had. When there is a greater mass, there is a harder contact between the alpha particles and the nucleus, which caused the particles to have a drastic change in direction. ","q5":"It does not make a noticeable difference to how the alpha particles travel.","q6":"It does not because the number of neutrons in an atom can vary because it has a neutral charge, and it does not do anything to the identity or charge of the element.","q7":"They move up towards the nucleus but all of them just bounce off of the nucleus. Though they bounce off the nucleus, they still continue their upward paths. ","q8":"They also bounce off of the nucleus, but their paths changed more dramatically. Some of them just veer off and continue on a diagonal path, but the others ","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
