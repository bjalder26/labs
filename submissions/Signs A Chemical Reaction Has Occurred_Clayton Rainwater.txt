{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Clayton Rainwater","observations1":"There were bubbles and incredible amounts of pressure. Wood splint immediately went out. Test tube became slightly warmer. no color change","observations2":"A lot of bubbles and small increase of pressure. small amounts of precipitant appear on side. color changed to yellow. flame became brighter but slowly went out and considerably warmer.","observations3":"bubbles form, flame went out immediately, temperature rose. slight hissing and small pop, no color change","observations4":"litmus paper immediately turned blue, strong pungent odor","observations6":"Zinc slowly break down while turning black.","observationsEthanol":"Slight condensation on test tube.","observationsMagnesium":" Magnesium burned incredibly brightly and gave off slight smoke. turned into glassy ash.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In the first test tube the flame immediately went out, suggesting carbon dioxide. In the second, the flame became brighter and when it did go out it was very slowly, suggesting oxygen. When the flame was introduced to the third test tube, there was a small pop, suggesting hydrogen. In the fourth, the litmus paper immediately became blue, suggesting ammonia."}
