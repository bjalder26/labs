This means that ice is less dense than liquid water, allowing it to float when it's placed in a denser liquid. ","q14":"To make the block float, you have to lower the mass and increase the volume of the block or technically make the object less dense than the water.\nTo make the block sink, you have to make sure the object is more dense than the the water it's in.  ","q15":"First off I notice that all of the blocks have the same mass but vary in size and density. \n\nWhen I put the A block into the water, I notice that the block sinks. The mass of the water increases to 105.00L.\n\nWhen I put the B block into the water, I notice that it floats. The water mass also increases to 105.00L.\n\nWhen I put the C block in, I notice that it also sinks. The water mass increases from 100.00 to 102.50.\n\nWhen I put the D block into the water, I notice that it instantly sinks. The water mass also increases from 100.00L to 101.25L.\n\n\n\n\n","q16":"After adjusting the mass to 8.50 kg","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":"","q24":"","q25":"","mass1a":"","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
