This means that ice is less dense than liquid water, allowing it to float when it's placed in a denser liquid. ","q14":"To make the block float, you have to lower the mass and increase the volume of the block or technically make the object less dense than the water.\nTo make the block sink, you have to make sure the object is more dense than the the water it's in.  ","q15":"First off I notice that all of the blocks have the same mass but vary in size and density. \n\nWhen I put the A block into the water, I notice that the block sinks. The mass of the water increases to 105.00L.\n\nWhen I put the B block into the water, I notice that it floats. The water mass also increases to 105.00L.\n\nWhen I put the C block in, I notice that it also sinks. The water mass increases from 100.00 to 102.50.\n\nWhen I put the D block into the water, I notice that it instantly sinks. The water mass also increases from 100.00L to 101.25L.\n\n\n\n\n","q16":"After adjusting the mass to 8.50 kg all of the previous blocks that sank are still the same (C,D,A blocks). The only difference is that B block isn't floating as high out of the water as before when the mass was 5.00 kg. ","q17":"When the mass is changed to 1.80 kg, three blocks now float. Blocks A,B,C float and block D still sinks.  ","q18":"I experimented with placing block B on the bottom and stacking block A and block c on top of it. Normally block B would float, but with the added blocks on top it now sinks. ","q19":"I added block A on the bottom, block D in the middle and block C on top. While block C is now above the water, it isn't necessarily floating. The block is just now on top of other blocks.","q20":"If the block is more dense than the water it will float. If the block is less dense than the water it will sink. Block B is more dense than Block D. This causes block B to float and block D to sink. ","q21":"After throwing all four blocks into the water, I can observe that block A sinks, block B floats, block C sinks, and block D floats. This is because block B and D are more denser than the water and block A and C are less dense than the water. Block A has a mass of 8.00 kg which is less dense than the water, Block B has a mass of 2.00 kg which is more dense than the water. Block C has a mass of 6.00 kg which is less dense than the water and Block D with a mass of 4.00 mg, is more dense compared to the water.

The log has a bigger volume compared to its mass, so it ends up having a lower density than water, which is why it floats. On the other hand, the pebble is small but pretty heavy for its size, meaning it has a higher density than water, so it sinks when you throw it in."}
