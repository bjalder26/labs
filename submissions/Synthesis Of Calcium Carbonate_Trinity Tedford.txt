After observing the beaker, I noticed a solid forming at the bottom of the beaker. The combination of these two chemicals created a double displacement reaction as well as a precipitate reaction.

I think our percent yield wasn't as close to 100% because of the loss of solids during the pouring process into the funnel. However, from the loss of some solids within this proccess 89.3% "}
