After observing the beaker, I noticed a solid forming at the bottom of the beaker. The combination of these two chemicals created a double displacement reaction as well as a precipitate reaction.

I think our percent yield wasn't as close to 100% as we wanted it to be because of the loss of some of the solid during the pouring process into the funnel. Me and my partner tried our best getting the remaing solid into the funnel with the use of deionized water and a stirring rod with a rubber policeman attached to it. I think our percent yield was somewhat close to 100% because we made sure to have accurate measurements during the process as well as heating the solid as long and as much as possible to get rid of any excess water in order to accurately measure the amount of solid."}
