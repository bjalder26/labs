I don't have other recorded percent errors to compare to, but I believe it was possibly on the high end. \n2. The sea water had a higher density, by about .3 g/mL.\n3. We did correctly identify the unknown solid.\n4. We did correctly identify the unknown liquid.\n5. No, it was not as close as preferred, but it wasn't terribly far off."}
