After calculating the density on sea water, I realized that sea water has a higher density than water. I do think that after getting all of my information for the unknown solid, based on the average density I was able to know that the unknown solid was copper. This was because my average density of my unknown solid was very similar to coppers density and closer to copper than any of the others given. After finishing the last experiment, it was easy to distinguish that the unknown liquid was methanol. Based on the information that I gathered, it led me to understand that the unknown liquid was closer to methanol than any other substance given. Based on the results of my percent copper, my answer was not close to 2.5%, the results that I was given based on my data was 7.8%."}
