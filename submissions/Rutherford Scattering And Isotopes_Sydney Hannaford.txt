{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Sydney Hannaford","q1":"Most of the alpha particles are moving straight through when protons are set to 20. ","q2":"When the number of protons are set to 60 it does change. Some of the alpha particles are still moving straight through the atom, but there are some that also are hitting the nucleus and bouncing off at different angles.","q3":"When I first started most of the alpha particles were moving straight through the atom. When you increase the alpha particles to 100 some are going straight through, some are hitting the nucleus and bouncing to different angles, and some are hitting the nucleus straight on and bouncing all the way back to where they came from. ","q4":"The more alpha particles that are fired the more chance of them hitting the nucleus instead of just going straight through.
