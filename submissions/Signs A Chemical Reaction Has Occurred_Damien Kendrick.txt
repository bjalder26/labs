{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Damien Kendrick","observations1":"There was a little bit of fizz and bubbles. The color did not change. And when the splint was placed in the fire went out and created smoke.","observations2":"The color changed to yellow and the flame tried to reignite. The temperature got slightly warmer also.","observations3":"The temp did get hot and when the wooden splint was placed in the tube made a popping noise.","observations4":"The ammonium carbonate disappeared. After placing the red litmus paper near the mouth of the test tube, it created very pungent smell similar to a bouncy castle. The paper also turned a different color ","observations6":"A solid black rocked formed. The color of the liquid changed to green and became very cloudy.","observationsEthanol":"Them flame started off big with enough ethanol. A little water vapor was formed. The color did not change, however the product inside the tube did start to melt and condensate","observationsMagnesium":"Really couldnâ€™t tell what the temperature was, however the light was very bring and it looked similar to the flashlight on phone. On the plate, it was white residue left after the product finished burning.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
