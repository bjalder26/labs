For example, when we retrieved the unknown sample, we saw visually it was just a little bit darker than the 3rd solution, so we predicted the absorptivity to be approximately 0.6. When we got .9 instead we knew we did something wrong and it was made known to us that we needed to rotate the cuvette in the spectrophotometer an doing so gave us the expected range. We also used adequate procedures and ensured that we knew exactly what we were supposed to be doing.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"orange","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"green","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"violet","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"yellow","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"red","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"yellow","colorUnknownCobalt":"violet","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
