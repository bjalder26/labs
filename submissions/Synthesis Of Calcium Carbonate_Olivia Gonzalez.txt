It was close to 100% although not exactly. I think one reason why the result wasn't closer to 100% was because the loss of product. While pouring, it is unknown how much product is lost or while walking with the watch glass to the oven. I also think that the heat could have played a part in why the percent yield isn't 100%. I think if the substance didn't get hot enough or boil long enough, the product wouldn't form into a solid and would still be mixed with the other solution as a liquid."}
