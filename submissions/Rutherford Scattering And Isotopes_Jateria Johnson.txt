{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Jateria Johnson","q1":"The paths start off straight and curve/skew to different directions when it comes close to the nucleus. ","q2":"When increased to 60 protons, the curves/skews intensify from when there were 20 protons. The lines are scattering going in left and right directions from each other.  ","q3":"The increase shows the alpha particles when they reach the nucleus they immediately scatter away in all directions. ","q4":"The alpha particles change paths because there are both protons in the nucleus and the alpha particles that drives both away from each other because they have the same charge. ","q5":"When the numbers are the same, the particles travel faster and in opposite directions just like when we changed the proton numbers. ","q6":"Because they have the same charge and when they have the same number of protons they move away from each other drastically.","q7":"The alpha particles move towards the nucleus and once it approaches it, they go in opposite directions away from the nucleus because of the protons in the nucleus. ","q8":"When the alpha particles have 60 protons in the nucleus, before the particles reach the nucleus, they are \"running away\" from the nucleus in opposite directions.","q9":"At 20 protons, the alpha particles would at least come close to the nucleus, while at 100 protons, the alpha particles do not reach the nucleus at all. ","q10":"They are going straight ahead/up on the Plum Pudding Atom. ","q11":"Since this model does not have a nucleus, the protons and electrons are evenly distributed throughout. ","q12":"Rutherford's experiment showed a concentrated nucleus that had certain amount of protons in it that would show different deflections of the particles.","q13":"Because they had the same charge and when they have the same charge they will repel/ move away from each other.
