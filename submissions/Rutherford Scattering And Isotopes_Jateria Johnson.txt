{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Jateria Johnson","q1":"The paths start off straight and curve/skew to different directions when it comes close to the nucleus. ","q2":"When increased to 60 protons, the curves/skews intensify from when there were 20 protons. The lines are scattering going in left and right directions from each other.  ","q3":"The increase shows the alpha particles when they reach the nucleus they immediately scatter away in all directions. ","q4":"The alpha particles change paths because there are both protons in the nucleus and the alpha particles that causes electrostatic ","q5":"When the numbers are the same, the particles travel faster and in opposite directions just like when we changed the proton numbers.
