","p3":"They will randomly collide with each other. ","q1":"They are not so far apart. They are close together but not so tight and their movement is a bit fast.","q2":"158K","q3":"There is less space and they're more tight. The motion is different because they're rotating and turning all over each other. ","q4":"273.15 Kelvin","q5":"They are more tight and move around less below its melting point. Above its melting point, molecules aren't as close to each other and they move around freely/faster.","q6":"They are tightly packed and require less space but move around more in a random motion. ","q7":"373.15 Kelvin","q8":"Below its boiling point, they are slower and more tightly packed and above its boiling point, they are not as close and they move faster. ","q9":"They are way more further apart and they move very fast in a random motion. ","q10":"Argon ","q11":"As a solid, the particles are tightly packed and have barely any space between them. They move in a fixed position. As a liquid, the particles have slightly more space and move around freely ","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
