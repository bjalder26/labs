They are close together but not so tight and their movement is a bit fast.","q2":"158K","q3":"There is less space and they're more tight. The motion is different because they're rotating and turning all over each other. ","q4":"273.15K","q5":"They are more tight and move around less below its melting point. Above its melting point, molecules aren't as close to each other and they move around freely/faster.","q6":"They are very tightly packed and but move around more.
