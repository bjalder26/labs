Above the melting point the molecules move more freely and spread out.","q6":"water molecules are still close together but can slide past one another, the molecules move more freely than in a solid.","q7":"373.15 K","q8":"Below the boiling point the water molecules are close together and move relatively slowly, Above the boiling point the molecules move rapidly and spread out.","q9":"water molecules are very far apart and move rapidly in random directions.","q10":"Oxygen.","q11":"In the solid oxygen molecules are tightly packed together in a fixed arrangement and vibrate slightly. In the liquid the molecules are still close together but can move around and slide past each other. In the gas oxygen molecules are far apart and move rapidly in all directions","q12":"The motion and spacing of oxygen particles are similar to water in that both substances have tightly packed particles in solids, more freedom of movement in liquids, and rapidly moving particles in the gas state. The difference is that oxygen has a much lower boiling point than water, meaning the transitions between solid, liquid, and gas occur at lower temperatures.","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
