{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Samuel McLeane","observations1":"-The vinegar did make bubbles when it reacted with the sodium. Splint was immediately extinguished when put in the test tube. The outside of the test tube was warm.","observations2":"-The hydrogen peroxide did make bubbles when mixed with the potassium. The splint relit when put in the test tube. The color of the liquid became a darker yellow. The outside on the test tube became heated. ","observations3":"","observations4":"","observations6":"-Copper loses bluish color\n-The zinc darkens and creates new substance","observationsEthanol":"-After lighting the ethanol with the lighter it continued to produce fire on its own. It got hotter and didn't leave any residue. The fire ended up melting the ice in the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"-Putting the magnesium over the bunsen burner caused it to produce and bright light for a few seconds. The magnesium gave off some heat and left it white.","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
