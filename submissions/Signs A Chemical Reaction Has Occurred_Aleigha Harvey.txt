There is no way to tell whether it was endothermic or exothermic.","observations2":"Yes, oxygen is created as a result. The color turned to a dark orange. There is no way to tell whether it was endothermic or exothermic. ","observations3":"No, there was a quick explosion and gas was released.","observations4":"No, Ammonia gas formed and the strip turned slightly blue. There is no way to tell whether it was endothermic or exothermic. There was a smell of ammonia present.","observations6":"Yes, the zinc turned to a copper color. Black impurities present.","observationsEthanol":"Yes, water formed in the cold test tube. Carbon dioxide was produced and cloudy solution.","observationsMagnesium":"A bright flame produced after ignited.
