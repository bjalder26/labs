{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Latiera Taylor","q1":"Most of the alpha particles are keeping a straight path. While only a few paths are slightly altered.","q2":"This does change path. ow more than half of the alpha particles are hitting the nuclei, causing their paths to curve instead of keeping straight. Every now a then one or two are close to being altered almost 180 degrees.\n","q3":"Now some are hitting multiple nuclei, but only a few are keeping a straight path. And now more of the protons' paths are being altered, and more are coming back towards the way they came from.","q4":"The more protons added increases the chance of more hitting a nucleus, compared to less protons lower the chance of hitting a nucleus.","q5":"No.","q6":"The neutrons charge doesn't affect neither the protons or the alpha particles charge, because only two positive forces will react to each other ","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
