{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Latiera Taylor","q1":"Most of the alpha particles are keeping a straight path. While only a few paths are slightly altered.","q2":"This does change path. ow more than half of the alpha particles are hitting the nuclei, causing their paths to curve instead of keeping straight. Every now a then one or two are close to being altered almost 180 degrees.\n","q3":"Now some are hitting multiple nuclei, but only a few are keeping a straight path. And now more of the protons' paths are being altered, and more are coming back towards the way they came from.","q4":"The more protons added increases the chance of more hitting a nucleus, compared to less protons lower the chance of hitting a nucleus.","q5":"No.","q6":"The neutrons charge doesn't affect neither the protons or the alpha particles charge, because only two positive forces will react to each other opposed to a neutrally charged particle.","q7":"Now with the nucleus only being in the center, only the alpha particles closes to the middle paths are heavily affected, but paths are curved softly. The outermost alpha particles are slightly affected almost keeping their straight paths.","q8":"The middle alpha particles are still more affected than the outermost, but now their curves are more strong. They are completely bending away from the nucleus. The outermost alpha particles are bending as well, but not as harsh as the middle ones. Every path is being affected though.","q9":"No path is making it past the nucleus, compared to when it was 20 and only the middle alpha particles were being completely altered. Now most of the middle alpha particles paths are coming back downwards and the outmo","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
