{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Aleria Griffin","q1":"Most of the alpha particles are going the straight path. Others curve off to the side.","q2":"The alpha particles start to go different directions. The particles seem like they are bouncing off and changing courses.","q3":"There are less particles going straight through.","q4":"I think this change occurs when more alpha particles are added to the experiment.","q5":"From what I've seen, there is not a significant difference between the two.","q6":"Neutrons hold no charge.","q7":"The alpha particles move away from the nucleus. They go around it.","q8":"The alpha particles move far away from the nucleus. They move out wide.  ","q9":"With 20 protons, it is more likely that majority of the particles will go straight through. With 100, more of them curve off not going straight through.","q10":"A straight path.","q11":"All of them are going straight.","q12":"This model is more accurate. It is an improvement over the Rutherford model.","q13":"Like charges repel each other.","q14":"Isotope is a form of atom that has the same atomic number. Which means the same number of protons, but different number of neutrons. Which cause it to have a different mass number. Its electrons can be the same number as the protons or different.","q15":"Elements are atoms with different number of protons. Isotopes are atoms of the same elements but with different number of neutrons. Atoms are tiny particles.","q16":"You can identify the isotope by the number of protons. You can also identify the mass by the number of neutrons and protons put together. You can also identify the electrons by the number of protons. They are the same.","q17":"Add the protons/atomic number to the number of neutrons. Thats how you find the mass.","q18":"Nature's Mix is the original composition of the isotope mixture. My mix is when I add however many I want to the isotope mixture.","q19":"The statement “In nature, the probability or chance of finding one isotope of an element is the same for all elements” is not accurate. The natural abundance of isotopes varies significantly among different elements. For example, carbon has two stable isotopes, carbon-12 and carbon-13, with natural abundances of approximately 98.89% and 1.11%, respectively. In contrast, tin has ten stable isotopes with varying natural abundances. These variations are due to differences in nuclear stability and the processes that formed the elements in stars and supernovae.","avgsi":"29","q21":"By calculating the average mass of Silicon in the rock.  If the relative abundances are approximately equal, it would support Bill’s hypothesis.","avgfemass":"55.861","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
