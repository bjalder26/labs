Others curve off to the side.","q2":"The alpha particles start to go different directions. The particles seem like they are bouncing off and changing courses.","q3":"There are less particles going straight through.","q4":"I think this change occurs when more alpha particles are added to the experiment.","q5":"From what I've seen, there is not a significant difference between the two.","q6":"Neutrons hold no charge.","q7":"The alpha particles move away from the nucleus.
