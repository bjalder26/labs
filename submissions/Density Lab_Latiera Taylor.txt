Block a mostly sinks, but doesn't completely touch the bottom of the water every time, only sometimes. Both blocks c and d completely sinks.","q16":"Now block a completely sinks.","q17":"Now block a and c floats, and b still floats.","q18":"Yes, now block b which floats on it on, can sink with putting both blocks c and d on top of it.","q19":"With putting either c or d, which normally sinks, on top of b, which floats, doing this one at a time of course, both will float while on top of b.","q20":"The smaller block, which is d has to have a higher density, making it heavier. And b having a smaller density, making it lighter.","q21":"Only b and d floats, because these two have the highest masses out of all the blocks which means their density is lower. Blocks a and c sinks, due to their masses being lower and making their volumes higher.","q22":"All of the block sink.","q23":"All of the blocks float.","q24":"Putting either a or c on d will make d sink, and putting a on b will make b sink. While putting c on b will make b heavier, it still does not sink completely.","q25":"Their densities are different, the higher density blocks sink because they're heavier and the lower density blocks float because they are lighter.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.50","den1a":"3.51","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":".40","vol1b":".40","den1b":"1","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1.00","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5.00","vol1d":"5.00","den1d":"1","sub1d":"Water","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"2.80","den1e":"1","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"18.00","vol2a":"1.59","den2a":"11.32","sub2a":"Lead","mass2b":"10.80","vol2b":"4.00","den2b":"2.7","sub2b":"Glass","mass2c":"2.70","vol2c":"1.00","den2c":"2.7","sub2c":"Glass","mass2d":"18.00","vol2d":"4.00","den2d":"4.5","sub2d":"Titanium","mass2e":"44.80","vol2e":"5.00","den2e":"8.96","sub2e":"Copper","mass3a":"2.85","vol3a":"2.85","den3a":"1","sub3a":"Water","mass3b":"6.00","vol3b":"6.00","den3b":"1","sub3b":"Water","mass3c":"23.40","vol3c":"3.00","den3c":"7.8","sub3c":"Steel","mass3d":"2.00","vol3d":"2.00","den3d":"1","sub3d":"Water","mass3e":"6.00","vol3e":"6.00","den3e":"1","sub3e":"Water","q26":"The log could have a larger size,  can still be small than the "}
