Block a mostly sinks, but doesn't completely touch the bottom of the water every time, only sometimes. Both blocks c and d completely sinks.","q16":"Now block a completely sinks.","q17":"Now block a and c floats, and b still floats.","q18":"Yes, now block b which floats on it on, can sink with putting both blocks c and d on top of it.","q19":"With putting either c or d, which normally sinks, on top of b, which floats, doing this one at a time of course, both will float while on top of b.","q20":"The smaller block, which is d has to have a higher density, making it heavier. And b having a smaller density, making it lighter.","q21":"Only b and d floats, because these two have the highest masses out of all the blocks which means their density i. Blocks a and c sinks, due to their masses being lower.","q22":"","q23":"","q24":"","q25":"","mass1a":"","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
