{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Lexi Townsend","q1":"When the mass was less the volume was less, and when the mass was more the volume was more. ","q2":"The block increased in size the more the mass went up. ","q3":"The more the mass increase, the higher the water level. ","q4":"As the volume increased, the mass also increased. ","q5":"The water level went up. ","q6":"No, the block did not ever sink. ","q7":"No, the aluminum never floats no matter the mass or volume. ","q8":"As you increase the mass, the volume always increases as well. ","q9":"The ice never fully submerged only a small part of it is above water, so no it did not ever sink fully. ","q10":"When I decreased the volume, the mass always decreased with it. ","massice":"1.40","volice":"1.52","denIce":"0.92","q12":"I did 2.05kg divided by 2.23L and got 0.91928 which would be rounded to 0.92. The same answer I got in my original one. ","q13":"The density of solid water, or ice, is less than liquid water which is why it floats. ","q14":"When mass is less than volume is objects floats. When mass is more than the volume it sinks.
