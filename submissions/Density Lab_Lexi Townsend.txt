{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Lexi Townsend","q1":"When the mass was less the volume was less, and when the mass was more the volume was more. ","q2":"The block increased in size the more the mass went up. ","q3":"The more the mass increase, the higher the water level. ","q4":"As the volume increased, the mass also increased. ","q5":"The water level went up. ","q6":"No, the block did not ever sink. ","q7":"No, the aluminum never floats no matter the mass or volume. ","q8":"As you increase the mass, the volume always increases as well. ","q9":"The ice never fully submerged only a small part of it is above water, so no it did not ever sink fully. ","q10":"When I decreased the volume, the mass always decreased with it. ","massice":"1.40","volice":"1.52","denIce":"0.92","q12":"I did 2.05kg divided by 2.23L and got 0.91928 which would be rounded to 0.92. The same answer I got in my original one. ","q13":"The density of solid water, or ice, is less than liquid water which is why it floats. ","q14":"When mass is less than volume is objects floats. When mass is more than the volume it sinks. ","q15":"Block A, C, and D all sank, and block B was the only one to float. ","q16":"Block B sank more, but not fully to the bottom. ","q17":"Blocks A, B, and C all float. D is the only block to sink. ","q18":"Yes, B block floats by it self and will float if only one block is on top, but adding anymore than one block on B block will make it sink. ","q19":"I put all the blocks in the water and block A will kind of float right underneath the surface. ","q20":"Even though they have the same mass, block B has more volume so it is less dense than block D which is why it floats, and block D sinks. ","q21":"2.00kg and 4.00kg floats, both 6.00kg and 8.00kg sinks. Regardless of the same volume, the more the mass the more dense it gets which is why the ones that have a mass of 6.00kg and 8.00kg sink. ","q22":"All of the blocks sink when the volume is decreased to 1.50L. ","q23":"All of the blocks float at 10.0L. Not all the same amount, but they all float. ","q24":"If you put the blocks with more mass on top of the ones with less mass they will sink. ","q25":"Even though they all have the same volume, their masses are different which makes their densities different. The lower the mass the lower the density which makes it float. The higher the mass the higher the density and it will sink.
