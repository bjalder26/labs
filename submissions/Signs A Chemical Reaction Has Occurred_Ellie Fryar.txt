{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Ellie Fryar","observations1":"flame went out","observations2":"liquid turned yellow, flame didn't go out, bubbles occurred, and the test tube got hotter","observations3":"ribbon turned white, bubbles occurred, temperature became warm, it combusted (popped)","observations4":"the paper turned blue, smelt like bleach","observations6":"liquid is turning clear and solid is now black","observationsEthanol":"condensation occurred, test tube became hot ","observationsMagnesium":"ribbon while burning became very bright and after it was burnt it turned white","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"Test tube 1 identifies with carbon dioxide, because when we put the flame in the test tube it went, it extinguished the flame. Test tube 2 identifies with Oxygen, because not only did the flame not go out, but it also got hotter. Test tube 3 identifies with hydrogen because when we put the flame in the test tube, it squeaked (popped). Test Tube 4 identifies with ammonia, because the red lithmus paper turned blue when tested.
