{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Lillian Murphree","q1":"They turn away.","q2":"The change direction, all the way and there is more.","q3":"They’re avoiding the dots completely.","q4":"As it goes up, obviously the direction changes.","q5":"No.","q6":"The nucleus will always repel the particles.","q7":"The alpha particles are now facing slightly away from the model.","q8":"More, and now are completely changing direction.","q9":"Slightly to completely away from the nucleus.","q10":"Mostly straight","q11":"Different directions.","q12":"Just as anything, everything get updated. This is not different. Better Tech.","q13":"Higher charge than the nucleus which reflected the alpha particles.","q14":"Isotopes are atoms of an element with protons and electrons just as any other, but with different neutrons. Thus causing, Different mass numbers, same atomic numbers.","q15":"Isotopes =  different amount of neutrons. ","q16":"Finding a mass number be protons + neutrons. ","q17":"find the atomic number, add the neutrons to get the mass number.","q18":"My mix gives you free will over what isotope your create, nature are naturally occurring isotopes.","q19":"It seems like it definitely varies from isotope to isotope, some have a single isotope. Some have multiples.","avgsi":"29","q21":"Averaging then dividing.","avgfemass":"55.84","q22":"It’s close against the relative mass.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"Well I could just enter in into the simulator, but could average it out and compare."}
