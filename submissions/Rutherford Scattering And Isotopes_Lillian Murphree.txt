This is not different. Better Tech.","q13":"Higher charge than the nucleus which reflected the alpha particles.","q14":"Isotopes are atoms of an element with protons and electrons just as any other, but with different neutrons. Thus causing, Different mass numbers, same atomic numbers.","q15":"Isotopes =  different amount of neutrons.
