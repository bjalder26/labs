{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Khristana Harper","q1":"The alpha particles go straight on the path until they come close to the nucleus then will avoid contact ","q2":"Yes, once the alpha particles reach a nucleus, the alpha particles will change direction","q3":"The alpha particles still go straight on the path but when they hit the nucleus, they will bounce off in different or even opposite directions","q4":"Because of the increased protons","q5":"No, it does not change how the alpha particles travel","q6":"Because the nucleus will deflect the alpha particles","q7":"The alpha particles move slightly away from the red/gray sphere","q8":"The alpha particles are forced further away, like a magnet repelling away. ","q9":"The alpha particles bounce off from the nucleus. The higher number of protons seem to make the particles bounce off further.","q10":"The alpha particles take a straight path","q11":"The Rutherford simulation showed the alpha particles going in different directions","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
