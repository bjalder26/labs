As the solution heated, more precipitate formed. It settled to the bottom of the beaker causing it to feel almost like wet sand when stirring. After cooling, the liquid separated from the solid, causing the liquid to appear clear while the white solid to settle to the bottom.","massFilter":"49.979","massFilter&CaCO3":"50.863","massCaCO3":"0.884","volCaCl2-2":"99.9","theoreticalMassCaCO3":"1.00","theoreticalYieldCaCO3":"88.4","conclusion":"We did not get very close to a 100% yield\n1. The main reason I believe this happened is due to our original measurements "}
