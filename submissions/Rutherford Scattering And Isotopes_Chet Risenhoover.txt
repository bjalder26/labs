","q2":"Yes, there are a lot more deflections in the alpha particles. ","q3":"At 100 vs 20 the majority of the alpha particles are being deflected and not passing straight through, where as at 20 most were passing straight through. ","q4":"Because as you add particles you increase the probability of one of those particles finding the nucleus of the gold atoms. ","q5":"No, there is no change.","q6":"Because the neutrons have no effect on the charge of the particles. ","q7":"They repel away from it when close enough. ","q8":"There seems to be an increase in the repelling nature of the nucleus as the number of protons go up. ","q9":"At 20, the nucleus was like a rock in a river, bending fluid around it but not really hindering the flow. At 100, the rock is almost a wall at this point and the vast majority of the alpha particles are being deflected. ","q10":"A direct path, straight through the Atom.","q11":"There are zero alpha particles being affected in any way as it passes through the atom. ","q12":"I think the Rutherford experiment proved a theory of what was already believed about the actual construction of an atom and the interactions within it in regards to charge and the relationship between protons, neutrons and electrons. ","q13":"Because both are positively charged which will force them away from one another during an interaction.
