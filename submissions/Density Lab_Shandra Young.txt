Which has caused the liter of water to be filled also. ","q2":"As the mass is increased the block appears larger.","q3":"As the mass increases, the block appears larger which means more water is needed. ","q4":"As the mass decreases the block gets smaller.","q5":"As the mass decreases the block gets smaller and the water level decreases also.","q6":"When the water increases or decreases the block whether big or small never sinks.","q7":"No matter how much the mass or volume is adjusted the aluminum does not float.","q8":"As mass of the aluminum increases the volume increases also.

The custom block sinks when its density is higher, meaning it has a large mass relative to its volume, making it heavier than the water it displaces. ","q15":"When I put each block in the water one at a time, I notice block A (wood) floats while block B (metal) sinks. This is because wood is less dense than water, causing it to float, while metal is denser than water, causing it to sink. ","q16":"Metal, brick, aluminum, and PVC sinks because the metal is denser than water causing it to sink. ","q17":"Styrofoam, wood, and ice blocks now float when the mass is adjusted to 1.80mkg.","q18":"Without adjusting the mass I can make blocks that would normally float by stacking the smaller blocks on top of the larger ones. ","q19":"When I remove the smaller blocks from on top of the larger block. This causes the larger block to float.","q20":"Even though Block B and Block D have the same mass, the reason one floats and the other sinks is that their densities are different, which is determined by their volume; since Block B is significantly larger, it has a lower density compared to Block D, causing it to float while the smaller, denser Block D sinks. ","q21":"Only Block A (with a mass of 0.5 kg) would float, while Blocks B (1.5 kg), C (2.5 kg), and D (3 kg) would sink","q22":"The volume of a block decreases, and its density increases. This is because density and volume have an inverse relationship. ","q23":"The blocks will expand due to the decrease in pressure, causing the blocks to sink.","q24":"Adjusting the mass I can make blocks that would normally float by stacking the smaller blocks on top of the larger ones. ","q25":"The reason why some blocks float and others sink even though they have the same volume is because of their different densities; the blocks with lower density than the water will float, while the denser blocks will sink, regardless of their equal volume.
