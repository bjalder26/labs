Which has caused the liter of water to be filled also. ","q2":"As the mass is increased the block appears larger.","q3":"As the mass increases, the block appears larger which means more water is needed. ","q4":"As the mass decreases the block gets smaller.","q5":"As the mass decreases the block gets smaller and the water level decreases also.","q6":"When the water increases or decreases the block whether big or small never sinks.","q7":"No matter how much the mass or volume is adjusted the aluminum does not float.","q8":"As mass of the aluminum increases the volume increases also. ","q9":"When the mass or volume of the ice is increased or decreased it will float.","q10":"As the volume of ice decreases the mass gets smaller.","massice":"4.70","volice":"104.70","denIce":"0.0449","q12":"When dividing a different mass of ice by a new corresponding volume the density decreases.","q13":"An object floats if its density is less than the density of the fluid it is in.","q14":"The custom block floats when its density is lower than the surrounding water, which means it has a relatively small mass compared to its volume. The custom block sinks when its density is higher, meaning it has a large mass relative to its volume, making it heavier than the water it displaces. ","q15":"When I put each block in the water one at a time, you will likely notice that block A (wood) floats while block B (metal) sinks. This is because wood is less dense than water, causing it to float, while metal is denser than water, causing it to sink.
