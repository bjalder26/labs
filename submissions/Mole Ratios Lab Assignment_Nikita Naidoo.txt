The small piece of copper wire (.09 g) could only react with a fraction of the available AgNO3. The copper wire's surface became coated with silver crystals, blocking further reaction. During the experiment, the copper also was not fully submerged and some AgNO3 was not in contact with it. And lastly, some of the silver crystals were fallen to the bottom of the beaker, making them inaccessible for mass measurement. ","priceAg":"0.17"}
