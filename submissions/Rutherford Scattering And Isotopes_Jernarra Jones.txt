{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Jernarra Jones","q1":"Most of the alpha particles pass through the gold foil unaffected, indicating that the atom is mostly empty space. However, a few alpha particles are deflected at various angles due to their interaction with the positive charge, the nucleus of the atom.","q2":"Yes, increasing the number of protons to go increases the positive charge of the nucleus. As a result, the alpha particles experience greater repulsion and are deflected more strongly and at larger angles. This demonstrates the stronger electrostatic force from the nucleus with a higher proton count.","q3":"When the number of protons is increased to 100, the alpha particles experience even stronger repulsion from the nucleus. This results in a greater number of alpha particles being deflected at larger angles or even directly rebounding. The increase in the nucleus positive charge intensifies the electrostatic forces between the nucleus and the alpha particles.","q4":"This change occurred because increasing the number of protons increases the positive charge of the nucleus. The stronger positive charge creates a stronger repulsive electrostatic force on the positively charged alpha particles, causing more pronounced deflections and scattering. This supports the idea that the nucleus is dense and positively charged.","q5":"No, varying the number of neutrons does not change how the alpha particles travel.","q6":"Neutrons are electrically neutral and do not contribute to the electrostatic forces between the nucleus ","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"-134","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
