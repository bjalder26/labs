{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Jernarra Jones","q1":"Most of the alpha particles pass through the gold foil unaffected, indicating that the atom is mostly empty space. However, a few alpha particles are deflected at various angles due to their interaction with the positive charge, the nucleus of the atom.","q2":"Yes, increasing the number of protons to go increases the positive charge of the nucleus. As a result, the alpha particles experience greater repulsion and are deflected more strongly and at larger angles. This demonstrates the stronger electrostatic force from the nucleus with a higher proton count.","q3":"","q4":"","q5":"","q6":"","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
