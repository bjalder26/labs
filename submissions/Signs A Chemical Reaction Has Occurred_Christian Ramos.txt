{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Christian Ramos","observations1":"The fire became extinguished and the bottom of the tube got cold.","observations2":"Bubbles formed and liquid became yellow. After splint test the fire on the splint became larger and the temperature became hot. After temp change color changed to orange.","observations3":"Formed bubbles and made a pop sound when met with splint test. The solid changed to the color white, and it became hot to the touch.","observations4":"No bubbles. The litmus paper turned blueish. No temp change but the scent became very chemical like. Cleaning product smell almost.","observations6":"Liquid did not change but solid became black and dissolved. Solid then became red and cold to touch.","observationsEthanol":"Ethanol caught flame and got more volatile with more ethanol present. Condensation formed on the outside of the cold test tube due to heat and cold difference.","observationsMagnesium":"Became very bright after catching flame. It changed its color to white after it became extinguished. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
