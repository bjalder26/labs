Solid then became red and cold to touch.","observationsEthanol":"Ethanol caught flame and got more volatile with more ethanol present. Condensation formed on the outside of the cold test tube due to heat and cold difference.","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
