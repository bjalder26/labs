{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Brooklyn Norris","q1":"They almost always go straight.","q2":"Yes, they start going side to side more.","q3":"They start going back down compared to when they were at 20, they would just go up and almost to the side.","q4":"The more protons, the more they are likely to spread out across the board with their path.","q5":"It does change it. The more neutrons, the straighter the path.","q6":"It changes because they are more neutrons present than protons.","q7":"Before they reach the nucleus, they branch out away from it.","q8":"As the get closer, they start to branch out even further before they reach it.","q9":"They immediately avoid it and turn almost back where they came from compared to when they were almost touching it and they would turn to avoid it.","q10":"They go completely straight.","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
