{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Brooklyn Norris","q1":"They almost always go straight.","q2":"Yes, they start going side to side more.","q3":"They start going back down compared to when they were at 20, they would just go up and almost to the side.","q4":"The more protons, the more they are likely to spread out across the board with their path.","q5":"It does change it. The more neutrons, the straighter the path.","q6":"It changes because they are more neutrons present than protons.","q7":"Before they reach the nucleus, they branch out away from it.","q8":"As the get closer, they start to branch out even further before they reach it.","q9":"They immediately avoid it and turn almost back where they came from compared to when they were almost touching it and they would turn to avoid it.","q10":"They go completely straight.","q11":"It is different because they would start to go side to side in the Rutherford Atom simulation compared to them going entirely straight in this simulation. ","q12":"To show a more in depth look.","q13":"They both carried a positive charge.","q14":"The atoms have the same atomic number but have different numbers of neutrons and will have a different mass number. They will have the same number of protons and electrons.","q15":"An element is only one type of atom, an atom is the smallest unit of measure, and isotopes are different variants of an element.","q16":"Add the protons and neutrons together, then figure out the number of protons compared to the element, finally write the isotope symbol with the mass number.","q17":"Look at the atomic number of the element on the periodic table, then you will add the number of protons and the neutrons to get the mass number.","q18":"Nature's mix is the natural number of isotopes found in nature and My mix is the predicted number of isotopes created in a lab.","q19":"","avgsi":"29","q21":"Add the isotope together then divide by 3.","avgfemass":"55","q22":"Iron has an average atomic mass of approximately 55.845 amu.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"Calculate the total mass and determine if the combination is a known isotope."}
