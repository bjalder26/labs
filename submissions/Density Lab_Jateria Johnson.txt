{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Jateria Johnson","q1":"The volume increases with the mass. The starting mass was 2kg and volume was 102L. When I increased it to the highest mass, the volume also increased. ","q2":"The block shrinks/grows in size according to the mass you set. The smaller the number, the smaller the block and vice versa. ","q3":"The water rise and falls according to the mass of the block. If it's smaller mass, it falls. If it's a bigger mass size, it rises.","q4":"It decreases if the volume decreases and increases if the volume increases. ","q5":"The water rise and falls according to the volume. If it decreases the water falls, and if it increases it rise. ","q6":"No; the block never sinks when the mass or volume increases or decreases. ","q7":"No; the aluminum automatically sinks to the bottom of the water whether the mass/volume is high or low.","q8":"The water rises always when the mass is increased. ","q9":"No; the ice never sinks whether the mass or volume is increased or decreased. ","q10":"It also decreases its mass size and the water falls.","massice":"8.00","volice":"8.71","denIce":"0.92","q12":"The density of the ice is still the same because it's still the same piece of ice it just changes in mass and volume but it's still the same ice.","q13":"Ice density is 0.92kg/L and is less denser than liquid water. Because ice is less denser than water, it will float. ","q14":"A lower mass will make the custom block float while a higher mass will make the block sink. When you change the volume to a high volume and high mass the block sinks and the water rises. When you change the volume to a low volume, the mass stays the same but the size of the block is smaller. When it's a high volume and low mass, the block floats on top of the water.  ","q15":"Block B floats and the water rises when added to the water. Blocks A,C, and D all sunk to the bottom of the water when placed in. Even though they all have the same mass, Block B still floated while all the others sunk. Block C had a different volume than the other blocks at 102.50L while Block D had a different volume of 101.25L. A and B had the same volumes.","q16":"Block B did sink when the mass was adjusted I think because of the increased mass. ","q17":"Blocks A and C now float because of the adjustment of the mass. ","q18":"Blocks A,C,D still sinks to the bottom while Block B still floats. When you place either of the other blocks on top of Block B it sinks further and further under the water and increases the volume and the water rises. ","q19":"If you place the blocks that normally sink on top of Block B it will automatically float only because it's on top of the block that's floating.","q20":"Both blocks have different densities. Block D must have a higher density than Block B.","q21":"Blocks B and D float will Blocks A and C sink. Because of the mass sizes, they float and sink differently. Because Blocks B and D have smaller mass sizes, they would float but Blocks A and C have larger mass sizes, they sink.","q22":"All the blocks sink and their mass sizes stay the same, but their actual size decreases. I think its because the volume is less than the mass. ","q23":"All the blocks float to the top of the water because of the increased volume. ","q24":"For Blocks B and D they still float but if you put Blocks A and C on top of either one they will sink. Only Block B will allow Blocks A and C to float. If A and C is put on top of D it will automatically sink.","q25":"I think it's because of its densities. They have different densities and are making each block do different/same things.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
