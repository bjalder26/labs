{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Jateria Johnson","q1":"The volume increases with the mass. The starting mass was 2kg and volume was 102L. When I increased it to the highest mass, the volume also increased. ","q2":"The block shrinks/grows in size according to the mass you set. The smaller the number, the smaller the block and vice versa. ","q3":"The water rise and falls according to the mass of the block. If it's smaller mass, it falls. If it's a bigger mass size, it rises.","q4":"It decreases if the volume decreases and increases if the volume increases. ","q5":"The water rise and falls according to the volume. If it decreases the water falls, and if it increases it rise. ","q6":"No; the block never sinks when the mass or volume increases or decreases. ","q7":"No; the aluminum automatically sinks to the bottom of the water whether the mass/volume is high or low.","q8":"The water rises always when the mass is increased. ","q9":"No; the ice never sinks whether the mass or volume is increased or decreased. ","q10":"It also decreases its mass size and the water falls.","massice":"8.00","volice":"8.71","denIce":"0.92","q12":"The density of the ice is still the same because it's still the same piece of ice it just changes in mass and volume but it's still the same ice.","q13":"Ice density is 0.92kg/L and is less denser than liquid water. Because ice is less denser than water, it will float. ","q14":"A lower mass will make the custom block float while a higher mass will make the block sink. When you change the volume to a high volume and high mass the block sinks and the water rises. When you change the volume to a low volume, the mass stays the same but the size of the block is smaller. When it's a high volume and low mass, the block floats on top of the water.
