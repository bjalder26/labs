{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Golden Sharpe","observations1":"Yes, Bubbles. Splint extinguished. No color change. No temp change.","observations2":"There were bubbles and the splint relit. The color turned yellow. Tube  also became very hot.","observations3":"Bubles were not as frequent, and pressure did build up although it was very weak. Did not react very actively with the flame. Flame immediately extinguished with a pop sound, no color change to note. But the tube did become very hot.","observations4":"No bubbles, the litmus paper changed color from pink to purple. was very hot and a pungent, nasty smell.","observations6":"The zinc darkened while the Copper II chloride became lighter","observationsEthanol":"No temperature change. No light, and no flame.","observationsMagnesium":"Ribbon caught on fire. Burned very bright so everyone had to look away as to not burn their retinas. But burned VERY briefly. Color changed from silver to white, with ash. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were able to decide which gas was produced by the way it reacted with fire in the different experiments. The carbon dioxide extinguished the flame much like if you put a lid on a candle. The second test tube was the opposite, it had a volatile reaction with the flame which led us to believe that there was pure oxygen in the tubes atmosphere. The third test had a very bright burn for a moment and an odd popping sound, which directed us to hydrogen to be the cause of the reaction. The 4th tube turned the litmus paper a blue, and blue is associated with 'basic' liquids like bleach."}
