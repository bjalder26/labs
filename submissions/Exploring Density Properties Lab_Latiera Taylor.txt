My percent error on my water density was low.\n2. My density calculated for sea water was higher than the density for water.\n3. I do not think I corrected identified the unknown solid because it was copper, but my density average was closer to silver.\n4. I do believe i correctly identifies the unknown liquid.\n5. My copper percent for pennies was close to 2.5 percent."}
