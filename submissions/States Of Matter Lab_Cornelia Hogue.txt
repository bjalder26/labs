The molecules' motion has increased to allow them to move more freely.","q4":"The melting and freezing point of water is 273 in Kelvin.","q5":"The difference is that below the melting point, the molecules are more tightly packed and are vibrating in place. Above the melting point, the molecules are covering more surface with their motion and become more spaced out.","q6":"When it is a liquid, the molecules are covering the entire bottom portion of the container, but they are all moving freely around the other molecules.","q7":"Boiling/condensation point is 373 in Kelvin.","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
