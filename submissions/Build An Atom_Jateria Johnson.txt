{"labName":"Build An Atom","userName":"Jateria Johnson","list2things":"While in the simulation, I noticed how I could take the numbers and use math to find each number. So I figured that Protons-Electrons= the amount of positive and negative charges; Neutrons+Electrons= Atomic number/Mass. The simulation also allowed me to form atoms using the proton, neutron, and electron balls which helped me understanding how many each atom has on a diagram.","particles":"Protons & Neutrons","particles2":"Protons","namea":"lithium-7","nameb":"helium-6","namec":"beryllium-8","charge1":"the same number of","charge2":"more","charge3":"fewer","formula1":"charge = # protons - # electrons","particles3":"Protons & Neutrons","formula2":"mass number = # protons + # neutrons","symbol1":"Element symbol","symbol2":"Charge","symbol3":"Atomic number","symbol4":"Mass number","symbol5":"Determined by the number of protons","symbol6":"Determined by the number of protons and electrons","symbol7":"Determined by the number of protons","symbol8":"Determined by the number of protons and neutrons","hyphen1":"fluorine-18","hyphen2":"boron-11","stability1":"Protons & Neutrons","stability2":"Electrons","stablemass1":"17","stablemass2":"18","isotopes1":"Atomic number & number of protons","isotopes2":"Mass number and number of neutrons","isotoperequirements":"Same number of protons but a different number of neutrons","relationship1":"Isotopes","relationship2":"Same atom, not isotopes of each other","relationship3":"Isotopes","relationship4":"Isotopes","relationship5":"Different element","ptable1":"17","ptable2":"74","ptable3":"17","ptable4":"52","ptable5":"No","n2":"hydrogen-3","an2":"1","mn2":"3","nn2":"2","ne2":"1","c2":"0","an3":"11","mn3":"22","nn3":"11","c3":"1+","n4":"magnesium-24","s4":"","nn4":"12","c4":"0","n5":"magnesium-25","s5":"25Mg-1","nn5":"13","c5":"-1","n6":"titanium-46","an6":"22","mn6":"46","nn6":"24","ne6":"24","c6":"-2","n7":"silver-107","an7":"47","mn7":"107","nn7":"60","ne7":"47","c7":"0","n8":"fluorine-19","an8":"9","mn8":"19","nn8":"10","ne8":"10","c8":"-1","s9":"12C","an9":"6","mn9":"12","nn9":"6","c9":"0","s10":"","an10":"6","mn10":"13","nn10":"7","c10":"0","s11":"14C","an11":"6","mn11":"14","nn11":"8","c11":"0","s12":"12C","an12":"6","mn12":"12","nn12":"6","c12":"-1","s13":"12C+1","an13":"6","mn13":"12","nn13":"6","c13":"1","n14":"helium-4","an14":"2","mn14":"4","nn14":"2","ne14":"2","c14":"0","n15":"oxygen-16","s15":"","mn15":"16","c15":"-2","s16":"40Ar","mn16":"40","nn16":"22","c16":"0","n17":"","an17":"","mn17":"","nn17":"","ne17":"","c17":"","n18":"","an18":"","mn18":"","nn18":"","ne18":"","c18":"","n19":"","s19":"","nn19":"","c19":"","n20":"","s20":"","mn20":"","c20":""}
