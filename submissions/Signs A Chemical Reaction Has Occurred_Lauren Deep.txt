{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Lauren Deep","observations1":"When adding the sodium bicarbonate to the vinegar bubbles occurred. Flame went out when put in test tube. No color or temperature change.","observations2":"Lots of bubbles when splint was put in test tube. When the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide was mix the color changed from clear to yellow. After the splint was added it reignited and the mixture got hot. ","observations3":"After mixing the hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon it bubbled and mixture got warm.","observations4":"After putting test tube with ammonium carbonate over Bunsen burner bottom of test tube produced orange flames. Red litmus paper turned blue when added. Pungent odor occurred. ","observations6":"After mixing copper chloride and zinc, the zinc turned black and the copper chloride became a less vibrant blue. Zinc became more of a rocky texture instead of the flakes. ","observationsEthanol":"Product on test tube was condensation. Ice in test tube melted showing temperature change. Yes, there was light and flames after lighting the ethanol with the lighter. ","observationsMagnesium":"After adding splint loud pop sound occurred and mixture got hot. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"I was able to deduce the identity of each gas in test tubes 1-4 by knowing that carbon dioxide will put out fires, oxygen will ignite them, the hydrogen gas caused the loud pop, and ammonia has a very pungent odor."}
