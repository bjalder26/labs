{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Lauren Deep","observations1":"When adding the sodium bicarbonate to the vinegar bubbles occurred. Flame went out when put in test tube. No color or temperature change.","observations2":"Lots of bubbles when splint was put in test tube. When the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide was mix the color changed from clear to yellow. After the splint was added it reignited and the mixture got hot. ","observations3":"","observations4":"","observations6":"After mixing copper chloride and zinc, the zinc turned black and the copper chloride became a less vibrant blue. Zinc became more of a rocky texture instead of the flakes. ","observationsEthanol":"Product on test tube was condensation. Ice in test tube melted showing temperature change. Yes, there was light and flames after lighting the ethanol with the lighter. ","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
