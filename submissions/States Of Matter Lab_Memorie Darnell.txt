{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Memorie Darnell","p1":"I think that the solids will be packed in close together.","p2":"I think that the liquid will be spread out but still close together.","p3":"I think the gas will be spread out and not close together.","q1":"The molecules are packed together and are vibrating. There is also not much space between each molecule.","q2":"It shows the temperature increasing.","q3":"The molecules get closer together","q4":"273","q5":"Below its melting point the molecules are more spread out but above it they are closer together.","q6":"they are close together and bouncing off each other.","q7":"212","q8":"Just below the molecules are a little spread out but when the temperature rises more the molecules spread further apart.","q9":"The molecules are spread out and continue to bounce off each other.","q10":"Oxygen","q11":"As a solid they are packed together and shaped as a square, when I changed it to a liquid, they got a little further apart and flattened out a bit, and when I switched them to a gas, they spread out completely and bounced off each other.","q12":"","q13":"I think my prediction was correct because the solids stayed close together, the liquids were close but not packed together, and the gas was spread apart.","q14":"","q15":"The pressure increases","q16":"","q17":"The pressure increases and the particles are moving faster and also continuously bouncing off each other.","q18":"","q19":"as I add more it to the particles the pressure increases.","q20":"The pressure increases and i believe it does because when the lid gets pushed down it creating a smaller space with not much room for the particles to move.","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
