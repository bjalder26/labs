The percent of error on our water density was low. Our percent of error was 1.0225.\n2. The density for seawater was higher than the density for water. Our density for sea water was 1.006 while our density for water was 0.988.\n3. I think we correctly identified the unknown solid. I believe the unknown solid was aluminum.\n4. I think we correctly identified the unknown liquid. I believe the unknown liquid was methanol.\n5. Our copper percent for pennies wasn't close to 2.5%. Our percent copper was 20."}
