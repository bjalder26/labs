{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Emily Moretta","observations1":"its bubbling and when the lit splint went into the test tube it immediately put the flame out. no temperature change.","observations2":"its bubbling and the color changed to orange. the glowing splint immediately started to ignite again. the temperature of the mixture didn't change. ","observations3":"its bubbling and the magnesium strip changed from gray to white. when the flame entered the test tube it immediately exploded and made a squeak sound. the temperature of the mixture is hot now.","observations4":"no bubbling but once the litmus paper entered the heated test tube the paper turned blue and it smelled like ammonia.","observations6":"zinc started breaking down and copper started to form as a participate and flaking off. copper II color changed from light blue to clear.","observationsEthanol":"the ice formed one solid iced and condensation on the side of test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"it caught on fire really fast and produced a bright light and smoke. it also gave off a smell.  it changed colors from a dark gray top a white gray.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":"I knew the first gas produced was carbon dioxide because when the flame entered the test tube it extinguished it immediately. second i knew had to be oxygen because "}
