{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Ashton Richardson","observations1":"Flame didn't last long, top of the tube clouded with vapor and there were small bubbles forming at the bottom. There was also a yellow tint at the opening of the tube, perhaps from the flame.","observations2":"The mixture turned yellow, and when the flame got closer to the solution, the flame grew brighter. Yellow vapor formed, and when after the flame went out, the liquid turned from cloudy, dull yellow to a dark, clear yellow. Bubbles formed at the bottom.","observations3":"As soon as the mixture was mixed, bubbles formed. The fire was added and there was an immediate squeak sound from the glass tube (combustion). The tube turned warm and bubble formation present.","observations4":"Strong ammonia odor detected, test paper turned blue, indicating the substance was a base.","observations6":"Zinc turned darker in color and began to break off into small chips, solution turned from bright blue to cloudy and dull in color.","observationsEthanol":"Flames in the dish were attracted to where the ethanol was present.","observationsMagnesium":"Flame went out fast, smoke odor present, magnesium produced bright light (fire) and once it went out, it left behind an ashes and an odor.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"Carbon dioxide was indicated by how quickly the fire was put out. Oxygen was indicated by the fire attraction to the mixture. Hydrogen was indicated by the squeak sound and combustion. Ammonia was indicated by its odor, and the litmus paper indicated it was a base.
