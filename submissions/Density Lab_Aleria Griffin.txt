That's how it is similar to the last question.","q13":"The density of solid water is less than the density of liquid water. Ice floats in liquid water because it is less dense than liquid water.","q14":"The increase in volume makes it float. The increase in mass makes it sink.","q15":"B-block floats. A, C, and D-block sinks.","q16":"It is still the same.","q17":"A and C-blocks float.","q18":"Yes. Placing the blocks that sink on top of the block that floats.","q19":"Adding two blocks that sink on top of it.","q20":"Block B dense is less dense than Block D.","q21":"Block B and D floats. A and C block does not. B and D dense is less than A and C.","q22":"All of them sink.","q23":"All of them float.","q24":"Placing a block the sinks on top of the one that floats.
