That's how it is similar to the last question.","q13":"The density of solid water is less than the density of liquid water. Ice floats in liquid water because it is less dense than liquid water.","q14":"The increase in volume makes it float. The increase in mass makes it sink.","q15":"B-block floats. A, C, and D-block sinks.","q16":"It is still the same.","q17":"A and C-blocks float.","q18":"Yes. Placing the blocks that sink on top of the block that floats.","q19":"Adding two blocks that sink on top of it.","q20":"Block B dense is less dense than Block D.","q21":"Block B and D floats. A and C block does not. B and D dense is less than A and C.","q22":"All of them sink.","q23":"All of them float.","q24":"Placing a block the sinks on top of the one that floats. Then reverse it to make it float.","q25":"The blocks with higher density sinks, while the blocks with lower density float.","mass1a":"19","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":".40","vol1b":"0","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"19","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"5","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"18","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"11","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"2.70","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"18","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"45","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"2.85","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"6","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"23.40","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"2","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"6","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
