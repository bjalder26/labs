There was no temperature change and no bubbles. ","observations2":"The flame burned bright before complete going out. The color changed from clear to yellow orange. The temperature increased","observations3":"There was a plethora of bubbles, fire went out immediately, after a pop. The temperature increased, Continuation of the bubble after fire went out. There was no color change","observations4":"The litmus paper turned blue, temperature increased, and the smell like ammonia","observations6":"Yes, there was a formation. There was a color change in the in the liquid from blue to dark green and cloudy. The zinc dissolved as well. ","observationsEthanol":"There was condensation at the top of the tube as the ice melted.
