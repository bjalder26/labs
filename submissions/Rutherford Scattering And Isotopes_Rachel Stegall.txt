","q2":"Yes, they are moving all which ways now. ","q3":"They are bouncing off the gold foils much more frequently. ","q4":"Because the more protons you add, the higher chance of it hitting a gold foil.","q5":"Not really.","q6":"I'm really not sure. ","q7":"They are bouncing off of the nucleus, but none of them really are moving funky. ","q8":"When they bounce off, they go in a very horizontal direction. ","q9":"At 100, they don't even hit the nucleus, they just start bending off before they get to it. At 20, they go straight ahead and just kinda bounce off.
