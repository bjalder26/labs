{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Rachel Stegall","q1":"They are pretty much going straight up and there is not really a pattern. ","q2":"Yes, they are moving all which ways now. ","q3":"They are bouncing off the gold foils much more frequently. ","q4":"Because the more protons you add, the higher chance of it hitting a gold foil.","q5":"Not really.","q6":"I'm really not sure. ","q7":"They are bouncing off of the nucleus, but none of them really are moving funky. ","q8":"When they bounce off, they go in a very horizontal direction. ","q9":"At 100, they don't even hit the nucleus, they just start bending off before they get to it. At 20, they go straight ahead and just kinda bounce off. ","q10":"Straight path upwards. ","q11":"The Rutherford simulation made the protons bounce off the gold foils and nucleus, but here they don't bounce off of anything. ","q12":"Because we had to include the empty space around the nucelus instead of it being so dense and small nucleus","q13":"Because the nucleus has a positive charge and the alpha particles repelled it. ","q14":" An atom with same number of protons but a different mass number because it has a different number of neutrons \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q15":"An element is a substance that can't be broken down into anymore substances. An atom is the smallest unit of life. An isotope is an atom with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons. ","q16":"By adding the number of protons and neutrons and that will give you the element's name followed by the mass number. ","q17":"I would add the number of protons to the number of neutrons","q18":"There are so many more hydrogen atoms in nature's mix","q19":"This is not true because the probability of finding one isotope of an element varies based on the element. in nature, some elements have isotopes that are more stable than others do. carbon-12 is more commom than carbon-14, but both are still isotopes of carbon. The distribution of isotopes really depends on certain factors. ","avgsi":"29","q21":"I could look up the actual abundance of each isotope of silicon in nature. ","avgfemass":"55.8530","q22":"well, the average mass of iron that I calculated is pretty close to the atomic mass of iron on the periodic table. it confirms that the calculation is accurate. ","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"I could compare the calculated isotopes to the natural"}
