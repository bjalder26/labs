","q13":"they were correct cause I thought of a literal way of what I think it would look like","q14":"States of matter differ in how their constituent particles are arranged, the movement of the constituent particles, and the closeness of the constituent particles to one another. Particles in a solid are closely packed and have fixed positions; the vibration of the particles in place indicates relatively low energy and temperature. Compared to a solid, in a liquid, particles are more spaced apart; they freely move and slide past one another. The energy and temperature are higher compared to a solid. Particles of a gas are much separated, moving fast in any possible direction, and with the highest energy and temperature. This motion and spacing change comes with temperature change, therefore impacting the state change between solid, liquid, and gas.","q15":"they get added to the stack of particles","q16":"chemical bonding","q17":"the particles start floating around everywhere","q18":"as the temperature gets higher and pressure increases which makes the substance spreads out more ","q19":"the pressure gets higher","q20":"the pressure gets high and the lid pops off","q21":"the lid explodes ","q22":"they go out flying out of the container","q23":"I learned that different temperatures change the state of molecules and how they are shaped. I also, learned that adding more pressure will cause build-up to a container making explode "}
