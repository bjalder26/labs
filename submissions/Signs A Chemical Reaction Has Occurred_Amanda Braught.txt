{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Amanda Braught","observations1":"Bubbles formed when vinegar and sodium bicarbonate were combined, fire was put out and created a white cloud. We dropped a piece of splint meaning that we could not tell whether there was an endothermic change.","observations2":"Light increased and flame grew larger, liquid changed color when combined hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide.","observations3":"When hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon were combined, bubbles were formed. When fire was added to the mixture an audible pop occurred and splint burnt out.","observations4":"Ammonium carbonate was heated up, when litmus paper was placed in the tube it began to turn blue indicating ammonia.","observations6":"Once copper chloride and zinc was mixed in a tube, the zinc turned black.","observationsEthanol":"Visible from combined with release of heat. Results in production of CO2","observationsMagnesium":"Heated a ribbon of magnesium in raw flames which caused a bright combustion that turned magnesium to powder.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
