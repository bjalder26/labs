Density can be defined as mass per unit volume, and objects that have lower density will float and objects with higher density will sink. Logs typically have lower density than water because it contains air pockets and is made of less dense material. Pebbles are denser than water because it's composed of solid minerals. The difference between density is that the log can stay afloat, while the pebble, being denser, sinks towards the bottom."}
