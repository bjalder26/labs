{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Emily Smith","q1":"When the number of protons is set to 20, the alpha particles are being pulled upwards towards the atom. When they touch the atom they bounce off and away. ","q2":"When I increased the number of protons to 60 the movement of the alpha particles changed. When the alpha particles get close to the atom, they move away. It appears that the alpha particles do not want to touch the atom. ","q3":"When the protons are changed to 100, the amount of repelling force is greater. The alpha particles now move away at larger angles. ","q4":"The increase of protons change how the alpha particles move through the gold foil. This is because the more protons you have, the greater repelling force the alpha particles have. When I started, we first had 20 protons, which had a less repelling force compared to the 60 protons and the 100 protons. ","q5":"No, changing the alpha particles does not change how the alpha particles travel.","q6":"Neutrons do not have a effect on the alpha particles because of their neutral charge. ","q7":"The alpha particles move away from the nucleus. They alpha particles are slightly repelled away but not forcefully compared to if the protons were greater.","q8":"When the protons are moved to 60 protn","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
