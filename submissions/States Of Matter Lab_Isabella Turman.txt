Neon as a liquid all the molecules are still together but not tightly packed. For neon as a gas, the molecules are roaming freely. The molecules for solid and liquid are slightly bouncing, and for gas it looks like they are swimming around.","q12":"The solid for neon was tightly packed and for water they were not. The liquid neon was also a little more tightly packed than water. T","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
