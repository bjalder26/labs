{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Isabella Turman","p1":"The molecules will be packed the tightest together in a solid.","p2":"The molecules will be spaced apart, but will still be next to each other.","p3":"The molecules will be the farthest apart in a gas.","q1":"The molecules are moving in place and packed in together.","q2":"Kelvin","q3":"They move apart from each other and start spinning.","q4":"273 K","q5":"Just below melting point they slow down and just above melting point they speed up.","q6":"They are packed more tightly together than solid water and moving a little more.","q7":"373 K","q8":"At just above the molecules start to spin faster and move away from each other, and the same thing happens at just below.","q9":"They are very spaced apart and spinning around.","q10":"Neon","q11":"Neon as a solid is tightly packed together into a square. Neon as a liquid all the molecules are still together but not tightly packed. For neon as a gas, the molecules are roaming freely. The molecules for solid and liquid are slightly bouncing, and for gas it looks like they are swimming around.","q12":"The solid for neon was tightly packed and for water they were not. The liquid neon was also a little more tightly packed than water. The gas of both elements were roaming freely. Water was also spinning around while Neon seemed to be slightly bouncing.","q13":"My predictions were correct for neon, but not for water.","q14":"Solids are tightly packed, liquids are closely packed, and gases move freely. If you heat them they will speed up, and if you cool them they slow down.","q15":"It slowly increases","q16":"Because they are alike.","q17":"The particles move apart and pressure increases.","q18":"The temperature and the pressure increase.","q19":"It increases until it can't hold anymore and the lid blows off.","q20":"It increases rapidly, because the molecules are so tightly packed.","q21":"The pressure gauge reaches overload and the lid blows off.","q22":"They travel out of the metal pot that they were in.","q23":"Solids are tightly packed, liquids are closely packed, and gases move freely. If you heat them they will speed up, and if you cool them they slow down. If you increase the number of molecules or temperature the pressure increase."}
