{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Aidan Esquivel","observations1":"When initially combined, the mixture had high pressure and was bubbling. When the splint test was conducted, gas was emitted. The glowing portion of the splint went out. No temperature or color change.","observations2":"When initially mixed, the substances changed color to a golden yellow. Pressure built up in the test tube, and when exposed to the splint, the tube heated rapidly, reigniting the splint and glowing brighter in the process. The tube has since changed to a deep amber color and is emitting the scent of the burning wood.
