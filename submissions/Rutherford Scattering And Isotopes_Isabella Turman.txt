{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Isabella Turman","q1":"They're going up","q2":"They're going sideways","q3":"They're going all different ways","q4":"They're unstable","q5":"They're going faster and more straight since I moved up the number of neutrons.","q6":"The neutrons stabilize the alpha particles.","q7":"They deflect from the nucleus.","q8":"The deflect even more from the nucleus.","q9":"They don't even go past the nucleus.","q10":"Up and Straight","q11":"The alpha particles aren't as scattered","q12":"Because Rutherford discovered most particles did pass through the plum pudding model, some were deflected at large angles, and a few even bounced straight back. From this he disproved the plum pudding model and found the gold foil experiment.","q13":"because they are both positively charged","q14":"An isotope is an atom that has the same atomic number, same number of protons and electrons, but a different mass number because of the different number of neutrons.","q15":"An element is a substance defined by its atomic number, an atom is one unit of an element, and a isotope is a variation of an atom of an element with a different number of neutrons.","q16":"first you would find the mass number, then identify the element, and then write it in isotope notation.","q17":"you would find the atomic number of the element and then calculate the mass number.","q18":"For My Mix I can add onto the blank black part but on natures mix I can't add anything and the hydrogens are already on the black part.","q19":"The statement is incorrect because isotopic distributions are not the same across all elements, and the likelihood of finding one isotope is not the same for all elements.","avgsi":"28","q21":"First you would calculate the average mass, then compare with the known average atomic mass of silicone, and finally you would check the natural abundance of each isotope.","avgfemass":"55.841","q22":"They are very similar, the periodic table's amu is 55.85 and what I got was 55.841 amu.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"based on the levels of nitrogen"}
