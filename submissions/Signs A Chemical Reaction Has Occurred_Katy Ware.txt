{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Katy Ware","observations1":"No bubbles but there was smoke and the fire went out.","observations2":"There was bubbles and smoke and the flame did not go out until later. The liquid changed color and separated.","observations3":"Made a loud popping noise. There was not enough hydrogen left to make a second pop.","observations4":"We heated the tube and waited for the color strip to change colors from pink to blue. We also smelled ammonia.","observations6":"The solid turned black and clumped up.","observationsEthanol":"Carbon Dioxide from candle made the lime water change color and leave a water residue.","observationsMagnesium":"Flame from bunsen burner caused sparks and bright light. i turned to salt and then eventually into a powder.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"There was different reactions for each test tube. For example some changed colors, some bubbled, some smoked, and lastly some smelled. This gave us indications of what the gas it might be!"}
