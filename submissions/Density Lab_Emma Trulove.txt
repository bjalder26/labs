","q3":"The water increased as the block got bigger. ","q4":"As I decrease the volume, the mass of the block also decreases. ","q5":"The water started to go down as I decrease the volume. ","q6":"No, the block never sinks because the water is denser than the block. ","q7":"No aluminum doesn't float; however, it does get bigger. ","q8":"The volume always increases as you increase the mass.  ","q9":"No, the ice never sinks when adjusting the mass or volume. ","q10":"The mass decreases as I decrease the volume. ","massice":"5.10","volice":"5.55","denIce":"0.92","q12":"I chose 2.90kg for the mass and 3.16L for the volume. When I divided the mass and volume, I ended up getting 0.92kg/L for the density. It appears as you increase or decrease the mass and volume along with it, the density will not change. ","q13":"The density for ice is 0.92kg/L which is less than waters density 1.00kg/L. This has less density which causes it to float on the water. ","q14":"The mass is what makes the custom block float and sink. ","q15":"Block A sinks and the volume increased. Block B floats and the volume also increased. Block C sank and the volume increased slightly. Block D sank and the volume increased very little. ","q16":"Block B is the only one that floats still, and the rest all sank like they did before.","q17":"Blocks A, B, and C all float now. ","q18":"Yes, I placed blocks A, C and D on top of B which caused block B to sink. Originally block B would float but adding the other blocks on top caused it to sink. ","q19":"I placed blocks B, C and D in first and then placed block A in which caused block A to float. ","q20":"Both the blocks are different sizes causing them to have different volumes and one is denser than the other. ","q21":"Block B and D both float and blocks A and C sink. B and D both have lesser mass than blocks A and C. This would cause them to have different densities and would explain why B and D float and A and C sink. ","q22":"All the blocks sink to the bottom. ","q23":"All of the blocks float to the top. ","q24":"When putting blocks, A and C on B it caused B to sink. When putting block D on A it caused it to sink. I placed block D on B and both the blocks floated. ","q25":"Some blocks weigh more than others causing them to float or sink.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.50","den1a":"3.52","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":"0.40","vol1b":"0.40","den1b":"1.00","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1.00","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5.00","vol1d":"5.00","den1d":"1.00","sub1d":"Water","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"2.80","den1e":"1.00","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"18.00","vol2a":"1.59","den2a":"11.32","sub2a":"Lead","mass2b":"10.80","vol2b":"4.00","den2b":"2.70","sub2b":"Glass","mass2c":"2.70","vol2c":"1.00","den2c":"2.70","sub2c":"Glass","mass2d":"18.00","vol2d":"4.00","den2d":"4.50","sub2d":"Titanium","mass2e":"44.80","vol2e":"5.00","den2e":"8.96","sub2e":"Copper","mass3a":"2.85","vol3a":"2.85","den3a":"1.00","sub3a":"Water","mass3b":"6.00","vol3b":"6.00","den3b":"1.00","sub3b":"Water","mass3c":"23.40","vol3c":"3.00","den3c":"7.80","sub3c":"Steel","mass3d":"2.00","vol3d":"2.00","den3d":"1.00","sub3d":"Water","mass3e":"6.00","vol3e":"6.00","den3e":"1.00","sub3e":"Water","q26":" The ratio between mass and "}
