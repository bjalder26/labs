","q3":"The water increased as the block got bigger. ","q4":"As I decrease the volume, the mass of the block also decreases. ","q5":"The water started to go down as I decrease the volume. ","q6":"No, the block never sinks because the water is denser than the block. ","q7":"No aluminum doesn't float; however, it does get bigger. ","q8":"The volume always increases as you increase the mass.  ","q9":"No, the ice never sinks when adjusting the mass or volume. ","q10":"The mass decreases as I decrease the volume. ","massice":"5.10","volice":"5.55","denIce":"0.92","q12":"I chose 2.90kg for the mass and 3.16L for the volume. When I divided the mass and volume, I ended up getting 0.92kg/L for the density. It appears as you increase or decrease the mass and volume along with it, the density will not change. ","q13":"The density for ice is 0.92kg/L which is less than waters density 1.00kg/L. This has less density which causes it to float on the water. ","q14":"The mass is what makes the custom block float and sink. ","q15":"Block A sinks and the volume increased. Block B floats and the volume also increased. Block C sank and the volume increased slightly. Block D sank and the volume increased very little. ","q16":"Block B is the only one that floats still, and the rest all sank like they did before.","q17":"Blocks A, B, and C all float now. ","q18":"Yes, I placed blocks A, C and D on top of B which caused block B to sink. Originally block B would float but adding the other blocks on top caused it to sink. ","q19":"I placed blocks B, C and D in first and then placed block A in which caused block A to float. ","q20":"Both the blocks are different sizes causing them to have different volumes and one is denser than the other. ","q21":"Block B and D both float and blocks A and C sink. B and D both have lesser mass than blocks A and C. This would cause them to have different densities and would explain why B and D float and A and C sink. ","q22":"All the blocks sink to the bottom. ","q23":"All of the blocks float to the top. ","q24":"When putting blocks, A and C on B it caused B to sink. When putting block D on A it caused it to sink. I placed block D on B and both the blocks floated. ","q25":"Some blocks weigh more than others causing them to float or sink.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.50","den1a":"3.52","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":"0.40","vol1b":"0.40","den1b":"1.00","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1.00","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5.00","vol1d":"5.00","den1d":"1.00","sub1d":"Water","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"2.80","den1e":"1.00","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
