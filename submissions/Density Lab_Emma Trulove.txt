","q3":"The water increased as the block got bigger. ","q4":"As I decrease the volume, the mass of the block also decreases. ","q5":"The water started to go down as I decrease the volume. ","q6":"No, the block never sinks because the water is denser than the block. ","q7":"No aluminum doesn't float; however, it does get bigger.

","massice":"5.10","volice":"5.55","denIce":"0.92","q12":"I chose 2.90kg for the mass and 3.16L for the volume. When I divided the mass and volume, I ended up getting 0.92kg/L for the density. It appears as you increase or decrease the mass and volume along with it, the density will not change. ","q13":"The density for ice is 0.92kg/L which is less than waters density 1.00kg/L. This has less density which causes it to float on the water. ","q14":"The mass is what makes the custom block float and sink. ","q15":"Block A sinks and the volume increased. Block B floats and the volume also increased. Block C sank and the volume increased slightly. Block D sank and the volume increased very little. ","q16":"Block B is the only one that floats still, and the rest all sank like they did before.","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":"","q24":"","q25":"","mass1a":"","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
