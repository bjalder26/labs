We also probably go accurate results because of our accurate measuring, along with wiping everything off before inserting into the machines.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"Orange","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"Green","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"Pink","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"Yellow","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"Red","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"Yellow","colorUnknownCobalt":"Pink","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
