Improper oven technique; it's possible that some of the CaCO3 may have been brushed off when removing from the oven, or some other reason involving the drying process.\n2. Scale inaccuracies - we had multiple incidents while measuring our products both before and after drying which dealt inaccurate numbers. There could have been issues with that as well. "}
