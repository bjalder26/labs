When we finished the trials, we got the average density of solid at 2.6, which is only .1 away from the average density of Aluminum.\nYes. When we finished the trials, we got the average density of the unknown liquid at .862, and the average density of Ethyl Acetate is .895.\nIt was pretty close, all pennies made nowadays are usually around 2-4 percent copper and 95-98 percent zinc, and we concluded that our pennies were 4.44 percent copper."}
