The density stays the same relatively","q13":"because ice is less dense then water. ","q14":"if the mass of the block is equal to the volume it will float in place where ever you put it. if the mass is less than the volume it will float above the water because the block is less dense. if the mass is greater it will sink because you are increasing the density of the cube.","q15":"they are all at 5.00kg. A floats under the water, B floats above the water, and both C and D sink top the very bottom. adding blocks makes the volume increase, and taking them out makes the. but each block makes the volume different although they are all the same mass different.","q16":"Block A sinks.","q17":"C floats. and now A floats above the water","q18":"yes. adding multiple blocks on top of the least dense. because we are adding weight on top of the less dense cube. we are therefor adding mass to it by adding on top of it.","q19":"it depends on what you mean by floating. by placing a singular dense cube on the least dense it will sit on top. making the less dense sink slightly and allow the more dense cube to float on top of it.","q20":"i think that even though they are the same mass. density can still be different.","q21":"B and D float while A and C sink. B and D have a mass that is less than the volume of water so they float. while A and C have a mass greater than the volume so they sink.","q22":"they all sink to the floor.","q23":"they all float above the water","q24":"by placing the C block on top of the B block the c block will float. and placing the A block on either D and B they will sink.","q25":"because they all still have different densities compared to the water. and the mass. the sinking blocks have more mass packed into the volume making it more dense, and the ones that float have less mass making it lighter.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"05.50","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"0.40","vol1b":".40","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1.00","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"5","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":"think of density like a ballon. the more you blow up a balloon the larger the volume it has, but it will still float on water. now take that s balloon and add some b"}
