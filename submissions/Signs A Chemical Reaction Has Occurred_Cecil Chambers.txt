When introduced to the gas of tube 1, the flame was extinguished entirely. When exposed to tube 2, the flame grew more intense, and after going out, it was reignited when exposed again. When exposed to tube 3, the flame produced a pop and excess smoke. In tube 4, the gas was instead exposed to litmus paper, which it had turned blue. This means tube 4's gas was a basic compound."}
