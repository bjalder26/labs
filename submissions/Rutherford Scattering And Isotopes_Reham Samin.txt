{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Reham Samin","q1":"Most alpha particles pass straight through with little to no deflection, indicating minimal interaction with the nucleus. Only a few particles are slightly deflected due to the positive charge of the nucleus.","q2":"Yes, more alpha particles are deflected at larger angles due to the stronger repulsive force from the increased nuclear charge.","q3":"With 100 protons, alpha particles experience more frequent and extreme deflections, and some even bounce back, indicating a much stronger repulsive force compared to the initial lower proton count.","q4":"The change occurred because increasing the number of protons strengthens the positive charge of the nucleus, resulting in a greater electrostatic repulsion that causes more frequent and severe deflections of the alpha particles.","q5":"No varying the number of neutrons does not change how the alpha particles travel because neutrons are electrically neutral and do not affect the electrostatic interactions between the nucleus and the positively charged alpha particles.","q6":"varying the number of neutrons does not change how the alpha particles travel because neutrons are electrically neutral and do not affect the electrostatic interactions between the nucleus and the positively charged alpha particles.","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
