{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Reham Samin","q1":"Most alpha particles pass straight through with little to no deflection, indicating minimal interaction with the nucleus. Only a few particles are slightly deflected due to the positive charge of the nucleus.","q2":"Yes, more alpha particles are deflected at larger angles due to the stronger repulsive force from the increased nuclear charge.","q3":"With 100 protons, alpha particles experience more frequent and extreme deflections, and some even bounce back, indicating a much stronger repulsive force compared to the initial lower proton count.","q4":"The change occurred because increasing the number of protons strengthens the positive charge of the nucleus, resulting in a greater electrostatic repulsion that causes more frequent and severe deflections of the alpha particles.","q5":"No ","q6":"varying the number of neutrons does not change how the alpha particles travel because neutrons are electrically neutral and do not affect the electrostatic interactions between the nucleus and the positively charged alpha particles.","q7":"With 20 protons, most alpha particles pass straight through the atom with little to no deflection, while only a few are slightly deflected when they come near the positively charged nucleus.","q8":"With 60 protons, many alpha particles are deflected at larger angles as they approach the nucleus, and some are even scattered back, indicating a stronger repulsive force from the more positively charged nucleus.","q9":"With 100 protons, alpha particles experience much more significant deflections and even bounce back, compared to 20 protons where most alpha particles pass through with minimal deflection. The stronger repulsive force from the larger positive charge of the nucleus with 100 protons causes more dramatic interactions with the alpha particles.","q10":"In the Plum-Pudding model, the alpha particles follow curved paths, as they interact with the diffuse, positive charge distributed throughout the atom, which causes some deflection even though there is no dense nucleus.","q11":"In the Rutherford simulation, alpha particles travel mostly in straight lines with occasional large deflections due to the concentrated, positively charged nucleus. In contrast, the Plum-Pudding model shows alpha particles following more curved paths due to the diffuse, evenly distributed positive charge throughout the atom.","q12":"Rutherford's experiment showed that the atom has a small, dense nucleus with a positive charge, contradicting the Plum-Pudding model. This led to a shift in the atomic model, emphasizing the nucleus as the center of mass and charge in the atom.","q13":"The alpha particles were deflected by the nucleus because they are positively charged, and like charges repel each other. The nucleus, being positively charged, repelled the alpha particles, causing them to deflect instead of being attracted.","q14":"An isotope is a variation of an element that has the same atomic number (number of protons and electrons) but a different mass number due to a different number of neutrons. This results in isotopes having the same chemical properties but different atomic masses.","q15":"An element is a substance made up of atoms with the same number of protons, while an atom is the basic unit of an element, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons. An isotope is a version of an atom with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons, resulting in a different mass number.","q16":"To find the mass of an isotope, you add the number of protons and neutrons together, as these contribute to the atomic mass. The name of the isotope is determined by the element’s name followed by its mass number, which is the sum of protons and neutrons.","q17":"To find the mass of an isotope, you add the number of protons (which is the atomic number of the element) to the number of neutrons. The mass of the isotope is the sum of protons and neutrons, as electrons have negligible mass.","q18":"In My Mix, you can adjust the proportions of isotopes, while in Nature’s Mix, the isotopes are mixed according to their natural abundance. This difference demonstrates how isotope ratios influence the average atomic mass of an element.","q19":"The probability of finding one isotope of an element is not the same for all elements, as different elements have varying natural abundances of their isotopes. For example, carbon-12 is far more abundant than carbon-14, while chlorine has nearly equal amounts of chlorine-35 and chlorine-37.","avgsi":"29","q21":"You could check if Bill's idea is correct by looking up the natural abundances of silicon's isotopes. In nature, Silicon-28 is much more abundant than Silicon-29 and Silicon-30, so the actual average atomic mass of silicon would be closer to 28 than to 29. This would show that equal parts of each isotope is not a realistic distribution.","avgfemass":"55.85","q22":"The average mass of iron I calculated (55.85 amu) closely matches the atomic mass of iron listed on the periodic table, which is typically around 55.845 amu. This confirms that the isotopic abundances and their corresponding masses align with the weighted average used to determine the atomic mass of an element.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"To determine if this combination of iron isotopes is likely to be found in dirt, you would compare the isotopic distribution with the known natural abundances of iron. Since the most abundant isotope of iron is 56Fe, with smaller amounts of 54Fe, 57Fe, and 58Fe, this distribution is typical for naturally occurring iron. If the dirt sample matches these natural proportions, it would be consistent with the expected isotopic mixture found in nature."}
