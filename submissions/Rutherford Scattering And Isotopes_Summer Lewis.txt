{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Summer Lewis","q1":"When protons are set to 20 the alpha particle gun is firing the particles toward the foil. However, most particles are going straight pass the atom.","q2":"Yes, because some are going straight through, and some are bouncing off when hitting the foil.","q3":"When increasing the number of particles, they will start to bounce off each other. Which causes them to go anywhere. Whereas if you had a low amount, you will be able to let them go straight through. In conclusion they are pulling away from one another and because there are more protons. Which causes there to be more nucleus in the path.","q4":"However protons would have a positiv","q5":"","q6":"","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
