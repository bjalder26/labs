{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"McKenzie Pegues","q1":"They move away from the proton, like reject going towards it. ","q2":"IT does, they move to the right or left of the proton while still rejecting hitting the proton. ","q3":"This time, they complete reject the proton, they barely go close to it. Meanwhile when I moved to number of protons on 20 they still passed it going upwards. Now they fully reject it going down or far to the right or left.","q4":"Because of the increased number of protons. ","q5":"Yes. The alpha particles travel closer whenever the number of protons is low, but the higher it gets, the further away they move to the right or left.","q6":"Because of how many protons there are","q7":"They bounce off of the nucleus. ","q8":"They don't come near the nucleus. ","q9":"20, they bounce off. 60, they don't come near it. ","q10":"They go up. ","q11":"Rutherford had the alpha particles bouncing off, or not going near the nucleus. This time, the alpha particles are going straight up. ","q12":"Because the electrons revolve around the nucleus","q13":"Because the positive charge spreads through the atom ","q14":"An isotope is form of an element that has the same atomic number and the same number of protons and electrons, but a different mass number and different number of neutrons. ","q15":"Atoms with the same number of protons with a different number of neutrons are called isotopes. ","q16":"If an atom has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, the mass number would be 14. So, you would get your periodic table out, and find the mass number 14. ","q17":"You add the number of protons and neutrons together.","q18":"My mix is the mix I'd do. Nature's mix is the computer's mix.","q19":"","avgsi":"28.08","q21":"You can subtract and see if the number is correct or not ","avgfemass":"55.84","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
