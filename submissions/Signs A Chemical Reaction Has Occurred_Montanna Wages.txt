{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Montanna Wages","observations1":"There were many bubbles, a smell, no color change, and the splint went out immediately. The temperature of the test tube seemed to become did not change temperature after adding the stick. ","observations2":"There were a few bubbles in test tube two, when adding the splint it relit, the color also changed to a yellow color and the test tube became warmer after we stuck the splint inside. ","observations3":"During this test, the liquid did bubble, the splint popped, there was no color change, and the test tube did in fact get much warmer.","observations4":"There were no bubbles while doing test tube four. The results of the testing resulted in a color change to blue and the temperature was very hot due to the bunsen burner and there was a very bad smell. ","observations6":"There is no color change, some of the solid has floated to the top, while the other sits on the bottom of the test tube. The zinc seems to have went from a silver color to black. ","observationsEthanol":"The test tube did in fact get warmer, there was just a light of fire, there was residue/ water concentration on the outside of the tube and the ice melted and the test tube went from cold to warm.","observationsMagnesium":"The last test was hot due to the bunsen burner. There was a bright light due to reaction and flames from the bunsen burner while in the end residue of ashes left over. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"Overall, the way my partner and I were able to identify each gas during tests 1 - 4 were based on the reactions to the splint that had been warmed up by fire. Based on the reactions to the gases we were able to easily identify them."}
