{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Chet Risenhoover","p1":"A slight vibration among molecules that are grouped together.","p2":"A more relaxed grouping of molecules that have far more movement than a solid.","p3":"Molecules not grouped in any way freely moving around. ","q1":"Molecules are grouped together, there is some movement and vibrating but they seems to try and maintain the shape regardless of the movement. ","q2":"Kelvin","q3":"The spacing actually decreases, the rigid form collapses and they start moving easier, less vibrating. ","q4":"Seems like its right around 270 kelvin","q5":"below melting point the spacing and motion is rigid, and vibrating, above melting point there is more movement and less rigidity. ","q6":"a lot of free flowing movement with molecules bouncing off each other. The spacing is even and distributed across the area. ","q7":"Right around 360 kelvin","q8":"Below boiling point, the molecules are close together and flowing around eachother. Above boiling point the movement is chaotic and unpredictable, the spacing is across the entire area, freely just bouncing around. ","q9":"When in gas form, the spacing and motion is the exact opposite of the solid form. Molecules are bouncing and moving every where and the spacing is all over the container. ","q10":"Neon","q11":"As a solid the motion is almost zero and the spacing is rigid maintaining a distinct shape.
