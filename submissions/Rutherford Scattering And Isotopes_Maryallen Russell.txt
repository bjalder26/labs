{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Maryallen Russell","q1":"that all the Alpha Particles are moving upward","q2":"Before if they hit the nucleus they didn't really now if they hit the nucleus it sends them in a different direction","q3":"the more you increase the number of protons the more the alpha particles bounce off of the nucleus","q4":"because the more protons you have, the stronger the positive charge is. so they might bounce off easier","q5":"as far as I can see nothing really changed","q6":"because neutrons have no charge","q7":"The alpha particles kinda move away from the nucleus ","q8":"the alpha particles move farther away from the nucleus","q9":"because the more protons an alpha particle has the more it repels from the nucleus","q10":"they go straight up through the plum pudding atom","q11":"because there is nothing repelling the alpha particles","q12":"because before no one knew that alpha particles can be repelled","q13":"because protons are positively charge and so is the nucleus so they deflect","q14":"An isotope is a variation of an element that has the same atomic number ,but a different mass number due to a difference in the number of neutrons. While the number of protons remains the same, the difference in the number of neutrons results in a different mass number for each isotope of that element.\n\n","q15":"an element is defined by its atomic number, an atom is the smallest unit of matter, and an isotope is a variant of an atom with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. The most important distinction between the three is that elements refer to a whole class of atoms with the same number of protons, atoms are the individual units, and isotopes are specific versions of atoms with varying numbers of neutrons.","q16":"you calculate the mass number by adding the protons and neutrons, then use the element's name based on its protons, followed by the mass number to name the isotope.","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
