{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Maryallen Russell","q1":"that all the Alpha Particles are moving upward","q2":"Before if they hit the nucleus they didn't really now if they hit the nucleus it sends them in a different direction","q3":"the more you increase the number of protons the more the alpha particles bounce off of the nucleus","q4":"because the more protons you have, the stronger the positive charge is. so they might bounce off easier","q5":"as far as I can see nothing really changed","q6":"because neutrons have no charge","q7":"The alpha particles kinda move away from the nucleus ","q8":"the alpha particles move farther away from the nucleus","q9":"because the more protons an alpha particle has the more it repels from the nucleus","q10":"they go straight up through the plum pudding atom","q11":"because there is nothing repelling the alpha particles","q12":"because before no one knew that alpha particles can be repelled","q13":"because protons are positively charge and so is the nucleus so they deflect","q14":"An isotope is a variation of an element that has the same atomic number ,but a different mass number due to a difference in the number of neutrons. While the number of protons remains the same, the difference in the number of neutrons results in a different mass number for each isotope of that element.\n\n","q15":"an element is defined by its atomic number, an atom is the smallest unit of matter, and an isotope is a variant of an atom with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. The most important distinction between the three is that elements refer to a whole class of atoms with the same number of protons, atoms are the individual units, and isotopes are specific versions of atoms with varying numbers of neutrons.","q16":"you calculate the mass number by adding the protons and neutrons, then use the element's name based on its protons, followed by the mass number to name the isotope.","q17":"to find the mass of an isotope, you add the number of protons and neutrons together to get the mass number, which represents the mass of the isotope in terms of atomic mass units.\n\n\n\n","q18":"the difference between my mix and nature's mix is that nature's mix already has a bunch of hydrogen-1 while my mix doesn't have any yet","q19":"The probability or chance of finding one isotope of an element is not the same for all elements. The natural abundance of isotopes varies widely depending on the element, its isotopes' stability, their formation, and environmental factors. Therefore, the statement is disputed based on the varied nature of isotopic abundance in the natural world.\n\n\n\n\n","avgsi":"29","q21":"To check if Billâ€™s idea is correct, you would likely measure the isotopic abundances in the rock and compare those with the natural abundance values of silicon isotopes","avgfemass":"55.842","q22":"\nThe average mass I calculated for iron is very close to the value listed for iron on the periodic table, which is typically around 55.845 amu","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"they are both likely to be found in soil because nitrogen - 14 is a common isotope"}
