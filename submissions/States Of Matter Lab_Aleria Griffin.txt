There is a lot of space around the molecules.","q2":"It is shown in Kelvin.","q3":"The water molecules start to compress together.","q4":"The water molecules start close together and still. When it's at its melting point, the molecules start to vibrate. The melting point is 32 F. ","q5":"They start off at a standstill then when you increase the temperature, they start to vibrate but are still close together","q6":"The molecules are farther apart, can move around, and are not arranged in a pattern.","q7":"The boiling point is 212 F.","q8":"Below the boiling point, they are vibrating frequently. Above the boiling point, they are vibrating rapidly and slowly taking up space.","q9":"The molecules in a gas are even farther apart than in a liquid and move freely with no pattern at all.","q10":"Argon","q11":"Compact together and vibrating as a solid. A little bit apart but still vibrating as a liquid. Move around freely as a gas.","q12":"In solid state, both have a fixed position, with limited movement. In liquid state, both have more freedom to move, but they are still close together and to","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
