When a liquid it fills the bottom of the container and moves more freely. As a gas it bounces off the container and is far apart. ","q12":"with liquid and gas, it was similar because of the spacing. With solid on the other hand neon is way more tightly packed than water. ","q13":"They were correct","q14":"States of matter differ because some elements need more heat than others to get to their melting point, while others are more or less closely packed together.
