A liquid's molecules are spread apart a little and move around a little. A gas' molecules are very spread apart and move around a lot. When you walk from one side of the room to the other, you have walked through a bunch of gases that make up our air.","q15":"they cling on the the particles in the container already ","q16":"positive and negitive's attract to each other ","q17":"they move fast and get further apart ","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
