{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Christian Scott","observations1":"-The Vinegar did make bubbles when it reacted with the sodium. Splint was immediately extinguished when put in the test tube. The outside of the test tube was warm.","observations2":"-The hydrogen peroxide did make bubbles when mixed with the potassium. The splint relit when put in the test tube. The color of the liquid became a darker yellow. The outside of the tube became heated.","observations3":"Bubbles did come out of the liquid when the magnesium was added. The flame immediately went out when put in the tube and explode with some noise. There was not color change, but the bottom of the tube was cooler than the top.","observations4":"The carbonate dissolved and the litmus turn blue when put in the test tube. It became hotter and the scent smelled burnt.","observations6":"Copper loses bluish colo.\nThe zinc darkens and creates new substance","observationsEthanol":"After lighting the ethanol with the lighter it continued to produce fire on its own. It got hooter and didnt leave any residue. The fire ended up melting the ice in the ice tube.","observationsMagnesium":"Putting the magnesium over the Bunsen burner caused it to produce a bright light for a few seconds.\nThe magnesium gave off some heat and left it white.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were able to identify each gas by the way we applied temperature through the Bunsen burner."}
