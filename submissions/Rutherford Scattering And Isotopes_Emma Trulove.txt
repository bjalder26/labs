{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Emma Trulove","q1":"Some alpha particles are going straight up, while others are going straight up for a little bit and then taking a turn. ","q2":"Yes, it did change the alpha particles. They seem to be moving faster and all of them will go straight up and then take a dramatic turn in any direction.","q3":"They are coming in at different angles and once they get to the nucleus they bounce off.","q4":"There are only protons and nothing is there to neutralize them and balance everything out.","q5":"No it does not change the alpha particles.","q6":"The alpha particles seem to be acting the same way. They go straight up and some make dramatic turns and bounce off the nucleus.","q7":"Once the alpha particles hit the nucleus they bounce off and go right or left. ","q8":"Once the alpha particles hit the nucleus instead of going up and turning, they turn and almost go down when they hit.","q9":"With 20 protons the aloha particles would go straight up and bounce off the nucleus. With 100 protons the alpha particles won't even reach the nucleus. They go up and take a turn way before getting to the nucleus.","q10":"They are going straight up and not turning at all. I believe they are also going through the atom. ","q11":"Rutherford simulation the alpha particles wouldn't touch the nucleus, some went straight up and some turned. While plum-pudding atom simulation the alpha particles go straight up and through the atom. ","q12":"I don't think the alpha particles just bounced off the nucleus and took random turns so people looked into it.","q13":"Both alpha particles and nucleus were positively charged.
