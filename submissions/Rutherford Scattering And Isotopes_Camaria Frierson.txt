{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Camaria Frierson","q1":"Most of the alpha particles are traveling in the same direction (up).","q2":"The particles start to move left to right.","q3":"The alpha particles move up and down as well as left to right.","q4":"I think that adding all the protons makes the atom unstable.","q5":"No they still travel the same","q6":"I honestly have no idea.","q7":"They go around, as to avoid, the nucleus.","q8":"They do the same as when it was 20 but more dramatically. The particles quickly veer to the left or the right.","q9":"In the situation with 20 protons the particles don't turn until they are passing the nucleus and in the situation with 100 protons the particles begin to turn lower before even passing the nucleus.","q10":"They take a linear path, traveling in a straight line until interacted with by something else.","q11":"In the Rutherford simulation some of the particles move to the left or the right and that does not happen here.","q12":"Maybe the model of the atom changed because it was incorrect.","q13":"They were deflected because they both have a positive charge.","q14":"An isotope is another form of an element that has the same atomic number (number of protons), same number of electrons, but a different mass number due to a different number of neutrons in the nucleus. Though the number of protons and electrons are the same, the variation in the number of neutrons contributes to a different atomic mass.","q15":"An atom is the smallest unit of an element that maintains its properties, an isotope is a variant of an atom of an element, an element is a category of matter defined by the # of protons in the nucleus.","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
