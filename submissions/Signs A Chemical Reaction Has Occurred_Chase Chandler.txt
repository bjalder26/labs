{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Chase Chandler","observations1":"There were bubbles immediately and incredible amounts of pressure. Wood splint immediately went out. Test tube became slightly warmer. No color change.","observations2":"A lot of bubbles appeared and small increase of pressure. Small amounts of precipitant appear on the side of the test tube. Color changed to yellow. Flame slowly went out and considerably warmer.","observations3":"Bubbles form, flame immediately went out, temperature rose. Slight hissing and no color change.","observations4":"Litmus paper turned blue, strong pungent odor.","observations6":"Zinc slowly broke down while turning black.","observationsEthanol":"Slight condensation on the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"Burned incredibly bright and gave off slight smoke. Turned into fragile and into ash if touched.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In the first test tube, the wood splint went out immediately, which is an indication of Carbon dioxide. In the second, the flame burned incredibly bright and it went out slowly which means it gave off oxygen. In the third test tube, there was a small pop and squeaking noise which means hydrogen was given off. In the fourth, the litmus paper turned blue very quickly, indication of ammonia."}
