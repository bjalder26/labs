{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Kapatrick Fleming","q1":"you will observe that most of the alpha particles pass through the gold foil with little to no deflection. Small fraction of the alpha particles may be deflected at large angles.","q2":"The paths of many alpha particles will show larger angle scattering showing that they are coming closer to the nucleus and interacting more strongly with it. ","q3":"The behavior of the alpha particles becomes even more pronounced in terms of deflection and interaction with the gold foil.","q4":"The the increase in the number of protons enhances the repulsion, leading to greater deflections of the alpha particles as they move through the gold foil.","q5":"Varying the number of neutrons does not considerably change how alpha particles travel through the gold foil.","q6":"If the number of protons remains the same while varying the number of neutrons, the paths of the alpha particles will largely depend on the number of protons.","q7":"With 20 protons, most alpha particles move through the gold foil with minimal interaction, but those that do come near the nucleus exhibit deflections due to the repulsive forces.","q8":"With 60 protons, the alpha particles display a pattern of movement that includes both the majority passing through with minimal interaction and a notable fraction being deflected due to the stronger repulsive forces from the highly charged nucleus.","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
