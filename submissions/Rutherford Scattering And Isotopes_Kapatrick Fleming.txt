{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Kapatrick Fleming","q1":"you will observe that most of the alpha particles pass through the gold foil with little to no deflection. Small fraction of the alpha particles may be deflected at large angles.","q2":"The paths of many alpha particles will show larger angle scattering showing that they are coming closer to the nucleus and interacting more strongly with it. ","q3":"Its more frequent and severe deflections of the alpha particles","q4":"The the increase in the number of protons enhances the repulsion, leading to greater deflections of the alpha particles as they move through the gold foil.","q5":"","q6":"","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
