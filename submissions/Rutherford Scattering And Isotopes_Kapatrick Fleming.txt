{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Kapatrick Fleming","q1":"you will observe that most of the alpha particles pass through the gold foil with little to no deflection. Small fraction of the alpha particles may be deflected at large angles.","q2":"The paths of many alpha particles will show larger angle scattering showing that they are coming closer to the nucleus and interacting more strongly with it. ","q3":"The behavior of the alpha particles becomes even more pronounced in terms of deflection and interaction with the gold foil.","q4":"The the increase in the number of protons enhances the repulsion, leading to greater deflections of the alpha particles as they move through the gold foil.","q5":"Varying the number of neutrons does not considerably change how alpha particles travel through the gold foil.","q6":"If the number of protons remains the same while varying the number of neutrons, the paths of the alpha particles will largely depend on the number of protons.","q7":"With 20 protons, most alpha particles move through the gold foil with minimal interaction, but those that do come near the nucleus exhibit deflections due to the repulsive forces.","q8":"With 60 protons, the alpha particles display a pattern of movement that includes both the majority passing through with minimal interaction and a notable fraction being deflected due to the stronger repulsive forces from the highly charged nucleus.","q9":"The key differences between the scenarios with 20 protons and 100 protons lie in the degree of electrostatic repulsion experienced by the alpha particles.","q10":"The paths taken by the alpha particles in the Plum-Pudding model straight trajectories.","q11":"The Rutherford simulation demonstrates significant scattering due to the presence of a concentrated nucleus, while the Plum-Pudding model leads to predominantly straight paths with no deflections.","q12":"Rutherford’s experiment was central in reshaping the model of the atom, as it provided clear evidence for a nuclear structure, leading to a deeper understanding of atomic theory.","q13":"The deflection of alpha particles by the nucleus, rather than their attraction to it, is due to the repulsive forces between like charges, the concentrated positive charge within the nucleus.","q14":"An isotope is defined as a variant of a chemical element that has the same atomic number, meaning it contains the same number of protons, but differs in mass number due to a different number of neutrons in the nucleus.","q15":"An element is a pure substance defined by its atomic number, an atom is the smallest unit of that element, and an isotope is a variant of an atom that has the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.","q16":"By identifying the element via the number of protons, calculating the mass number by adding protons and neutrons, and combining this information to name the isotope.","q17":"Given the element’s name and the number of neutrons, identify the atomic number to find the number of protons, calculate the mass number by adding the protons and neutrons.","q18":"“My Mix” allows for customizable experimentation with isotopes to understand the concept of average atomic mass, while “Nature’s Mix” presents the real-world isotopic ratios that exist in nature.","q19":"The statement “In nature, the probability or chance of finding one isotope of an element is the same for all elements” can be effectively disputed based on the evidence presented in isotope distribution simulations. By utilizing the simulation to analyze different elements, it becomes clear that the abundance of isotopes varies significantly from one element to another. When examining chlorine, the simulation reveals that approximately 75% of naturally occurring chlorine is chlorine-35, while only about 25% is chlorine-37. In contrast, elements like carbon have a more even distribution between carbon-12 and carbon-13, with carbon-12 being predominant. The chance of encountering a specific isotope for different elements is not uniform rather, it is influenced by the natural processes.","avgsi":"29","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
