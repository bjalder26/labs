{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Maryallen Russell","p1":"for solid i think the molecules will be tightly packed","p2":"for liquid I think they will move around a little more but not like crazy","p3":"for gas they will move all over the place","q1":"The molecules have some space between them but not much and they aren't moving very much.","q2":"the temperature in rising","q3":"the molecules start to rise and move apart","q4":"273.5 ","q5":"when wamring then the melting point the molecules move away from eachother and when its below they do the opposite","q6":"the spacing is pretty much the same but the molecules are moving faster\n","q7":"373.15","q8":"the higher in heat the more condenses while when you add cold they move apart","q9":"they are pretty spaced out and moving a lot","q10":"oxygen","q11":"solid the particles are very tightly packed, liquid the particles are not as tightly pack but they are not moving around a lot, and gas the particles are all over the place.","q12":"they are very similar but like with water when solid it isn't as tightly packed as oxygen","q13":"yes they were correct","q14":"the states of matter are different based on whether its solid, liquid, and gas also when things heat up the particles start to change matter","q15":"the particles immediately moves to the rest of the particles","q16":"because are going into the same environment as the rest of the particles","q17":"the particles begin to spread apart","q18":"the pressure rises when the temperature rises","q19":"the pressure rises","q20":"when you start to push the top down the particles begin to condense","q21":"the top pops off","q22":"they all start floating out","q23":"I learned that depending on the state of the matter the particles change and when you add heat they change and when you add cold it changes too."}
