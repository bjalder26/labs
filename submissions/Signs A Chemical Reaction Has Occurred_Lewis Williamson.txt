{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Lewis Williamson","observations1":"the lit splint went out and it slightly got hotter","observations2":"started to bubble, turned yellow, made a brighter flame, got hot ","observations3":"heated up, bubbles occured, made a popping noise, turned white","observations4":"the paper turned blue, and the test tube fogged up and the solid vaporized, had a smell of smelling salts","observations6":"liquid turned to a sewer green color and turned murky. the solid turned into a black color and eroded a little bit","observationsEthanol":"the ethanol lit on fire and condensation formed on the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"bright light and emitted smoke","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In tube one the flame went out meaning the gas was carbon dioxide. In tube two the flame got slightly bigger meaning oxygen was the emitted gas. In tube three there was a popping sound which means hydrogen was the gas. In tube four there was a smell that smelled like ammonia telling me that it is ammonia. In conclusion I was able to tell what type of gas was emitted by the mixture due to what happened after heat was added. "}
