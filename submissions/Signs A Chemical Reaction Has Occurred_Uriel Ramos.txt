We were able to deduce the identity of the gas in test tube two, because when a glowing splint was inserted into it, the gas reignited the flame, which is a characteristic of oxygen. We were able to identify the gas in test tube three because when a flame was inserted into the tube it popped, and hydrogen is known to accelerate flames. "}
