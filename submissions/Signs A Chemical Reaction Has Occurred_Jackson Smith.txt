Once splint was added to test tube, the flame immediately went out. ","observations2":"Bubbles formed after mixing hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide, Liquid immediately changed from clear, to yellow. Once splint was added the flame went brighter. ","observations3":"The mixture bubbled, pop when splint was added, there was zero color change. Bottom of test tube started warming up ","observations4":"No bubbles, litmus paper turned from red to blue. The bottom of test tube was warm due to the Bunsen burner, and had a smell. ","observations6":"Mixture changed from a light blue and slowly turned clear. Precipitation started forming over time in the test tube.
