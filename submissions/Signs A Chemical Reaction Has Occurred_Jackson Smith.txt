{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Jackson Smith","observations1":"bubbles formed when sodium bicarbonate was mixed, there was not a color change, no noticeable temperature change. Once splint was added to test tube, the flame immediately went out. ","observations2":"Bubbles formed after mixing hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide, Liquid immediately changed from clear, to yellow. Once splint was added the flame went brighter. ","observations3":"The mixture bubbled, pop when splint was added, there was zero color change. Bottom of test tube started warming up ","observations4":"No bubbles, litmus paper turned from red to blue. The bottom of test tube was warm due to the Bunsen burner, and had a smell. ","observations6":"Mixture changed from a light blue and slowly turned clear. Precipitation started forming over time in the test tube. ","observationsEthanol":"Top of test tube was hot, the bottom of the test tube was cold, visible flame from ethanol, condensation on test tube","observationsMagnesium":"once lit, the magnesium had a bright white flame, similar to a welder. Once set in watch glass it would alternate from a bright white flame to an orange flame then ultimately went out and turned into an ashy dust. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were able to deduce the identity of each glass in the test tubes through the litmus test, and the gas test. We also used our nose to identify the ammonia due to its resemblance of cat pee. "}
