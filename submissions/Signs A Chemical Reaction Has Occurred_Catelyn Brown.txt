{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Catelyn Brown","observations1":"There were bubbles when we added the sodium bicarbonate to the vinegar. The temperature of the test tube stayed the same. There was no color change and smoke was collected the the top of the tube. ","observations2":"When we added potassium to hydrogen peroxide, the color changed to yellow with lots of fizzy bubbles. The temperature stayed the same. In The wooden splint test, the bubble and fizz picked up with the heat. ","observations3":"When the magnesium strip was dropped, the bubbles began. During the splint test, there was a pop. The strip turned white the longer it stayed in the acid. It gradually got warmer. ","observations4":"There were no bubble during this reaction. The smell became very evident as we heated the tube. There was no color change to the ammonium, but the litmus paper did turn blue. ","observations6":"The zinc sunk to the bottom and became one big hard clump. The zinc also turned black when it came in contact to the copper. ","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
