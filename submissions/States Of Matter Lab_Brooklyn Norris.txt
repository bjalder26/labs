{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Brooklyn Norris","p1":"I predict that the solid will remain solid during the experiement.","p2":"I predict that the liquid will remain around the bottom but will float more. ","p3":"I predict that the gas will float all around and not remain in the same spot.","q1":"I see that the molecules are huddled around the bottom in a square shape. They are constantly moving but not around. ","q2":"The temperature is 345K.","q3":"They are spinning around but not floating to the top.","q4":"The temperature is 273.1","q5":"The closer to it, the more they start to float away. The further they are from it, the more condensed they become.","q6":"They are extremely close together and spin very rapidly.","q7":"The temperature is 373.1K.","q8":"They spin very fast above it and below it, they start to drift away from one another.","q9":"They do not stay in one spot. They are constantly moving every way you could think of.","q10":"I selected oxygen.","q11":"As a solid, it is very condensed at the bottom but they are still moving. As a liquid, they remain together but begin to float around each other. As a gas, they are in pairs of 2 and float from top to bottom.","q12":"With the solid, the remain together and move. With liquid, they move but still also stay together but with gas, they spin more rapidly with water. The differences are that the gas in oxygen travel as pairs and with water, they travel as a trio.","q13":"They were correct.","q14":"They are different because regardless of the element, a solid, a liquid, and a gas are going to remain the same and react the same. The temperature does play a part in the way they interact with each other.","q15":"The pressure increases.","q16":"This is due to intermolecular forces.","q17":"The pressure increases but the particles begin to move around rapidly.","q18":"The more the temperature increases, the more the pressure will too. The particles will also move around a lot faster.","q19":"The pressure increases.","q20":"The pressure increases. This is because of the force of the finger limiting the area of which the particles can go and causes the pressure to increase inside the container.","q21":"It will explode.","q22":"They begin to slow down and descend to the bottom but will still continue to move.","q23":"The more force or the higher the temperature, the more the pressure will increase. My predictions were correct and I do believe that regardless of the element or state of matter, they will all react the same with gas moving around a lot and solid staying together but still moving."}
