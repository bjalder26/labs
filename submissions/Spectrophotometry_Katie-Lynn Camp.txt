Another reason we got it under 20% is that we read the instructions very carefully and multiple times.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"","identityA":"","colorB":"","identityB":"","colorC":"","identityC":"","colorD":"","identityD":"","colorE":"","identityE":"","colorUnknown":"","colorUnknownCobalt":"","identityUnknown":""}
