{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Agustin Chaidez","q1":"they tand to be pushed away the closer they are to the atoms.","q2":"the closer the particles are the faster they are pushed away and they cant get as close to the atom anymore.","q3":"The Particles get pushed away with much more force then before.","q4":"due to how the alpha articles are positively charged makes them get pushed away. ","q5":"it doesn't change much they stay on the same paths as before ","q6":"neutrons probably don't affect eh particles much ","q7":"they move and are able to get extremely close to the nucleus and slowly move away from it . ","q8":"they aren't able to get as close and the nucleus. particles start to curve away from the nucleus from a ways away ","q9":"The particles repulse each other a lot more at 100 protons then 20 protons. ","q10":"they take a straight path.","q11":"the plum atom has multiple nucleus.
