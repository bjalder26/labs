","q3":"Similar as if they were 60 protons but they move to a different directions by far before even touching the nucleus.","q4":"Because of adding more protons adds more charge.","q5":"NO","q6":"Because by changing the number of neutrons doesn’t effect the alpha particles, also I believe because neutrons doesn’t have aa charge.","q7":"Almost touching the nucleus but Curving away when they get closer.","q8":"Curving away from the nucleus by far before touching it.","q9":"with 100 protons alpha particles curving away from the nucleus by way more far before touching then the 20 protons.","q10":"Straight path","q11":"all paths keep moving straight forward without curving.","q12":"because he discovered the atomic nucleus.","q13":"both the alpha particles and the nucleus are positively charged, causing electrostatic repulsion between them.","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"28.97","q21":"","avgfemass":"55.845","q22":"The calculated average mass of iron 55.845 matches the atomic mass of iron (Fe) on the periodic table, which is also listed as 55.845 amu.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
