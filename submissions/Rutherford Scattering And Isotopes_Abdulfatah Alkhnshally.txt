","q2":"yes, paths avoiding hitting the nucleus and going to different directions.  ","q3":"Similar as if they were 60 protons but they move to a different directions by far before even touching the nucleus.","q4":"Because of adding more protons adds more charge.","q5":"NO","q6":"Because by changing the number of neutrons doesn’t effect the alpha particles, also I believe because neutrons doesn’t have aa charge.","q7":"Almost touching the nucleus but Curving away when they get closer.","q8":"Curving away from the nucleus by far before touching it.","q9":"with 100 protons alpha particles curving away from the nucleus by way more far before touching then the 20 protons.","q10":"Straight path","q11":"all paths keep moving straight forward without curving.","q12":"because he discovered the atomic nucleus.","q13":"both the alpha particles and the nucleus are positively charged, causing electrostatic repulsion between them.","q14":"An isotope is an element that has the same atomic number, the same number of protons and electrons but a different mass number due to a different number of neutrons.","q15":"\nAn element is a substance consisting of only one type of atom, known by its atomic number. An atom is the smallest unit of an element, made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. An isotope is a variant of an element’s atoms that has the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.","q16":" Add the number of protons and neutrons. This sum represents the isotope's mass number, then find it on the periodic table.","q17":"by Looking up the atomic number of the element on the periodic table, then Adding the number of protons to the number of neutrons.","q18":"My Mi involves custom-prepared mixtures, Nature’s Mix involves naturally occurring mixtures.","q19":"the probability or chance of finding a particular isotope is not consistent across all elements but varies according to nuclear properties and natural processes.","avgsi":"28.97","q21":"by Calculating the Average Mass. ","avgfemass":"55.845","q22":"The calculated average mass of iron 55.845 matches the atomic mass of iron (Fe) on the periodic table, which is also listed as 55.845 amu.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
