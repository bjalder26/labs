","q2":"yes, paths avoiding hitting the nucleus and going to different directions.  ","q3":"Similar as if they were 60 protons but they move to a different directions by far before even touching the nucleus.","q4":"Because of adding more protons adds more charge.","q5":"NO","q6":"Because by changing the number of neutrons doesn’t effect the alpha particles, also I believe because neutrons doesn’t have aa charge.","q7":"Almost touching the nucleus but Curving away when they get closer.","q8":"Curving away from the nucleus but Curving away.","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
