{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Matthew Joyner","observations1":"There were bubbles when we combined the 2 substances. The fire on the splint test immediately went out when we put it in the test tube. The temperature remained the same.","observations2":"Yes there were bubbles, the splint test resulted in the flame of the splint catching more fire when introduced to the test tube. The color changed from clear to yellow, the temperature increased as well.","observations3":"There were bubbles and the smell changed, the fire from the splint test popped when introduced to the test tube, the color remained the same, and the temperature increased.","observations4":"No bubbles, the litmus test showed the strip turning from pink to blue, there was no color change to the substance, other than the test tube being hot from the burner, the substance didn't really change temperature. It smelled pungent. ","observations6":"The solid zinc turned black, some floated and some sank. The zinc stuck together once submerged in the copper.","observationsEthanol":"There were some bubbles, no color change, and the temperature stayed the same but melted the Ice because the ethanol produced flames after igniting with lighter. ","observationsMagnesium":"It was hot, once we put it over the burner, it caught fire and gave off this really bright white light. The entirety of the Magnesium strip burned down to dust.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"The first test tube splint test resulted in the fire being snuffed out, which is a sign of Carbon Dioxide \nThe second test tube splint test resulted in the fire producing more flame,  which was a sign of oxygen because oxygen provides the space for fire to grow.\nThe third test tube when we did the splint test it resulted in the fire popping on initial interaction with the test tube, which is a sign for Hydrogen because it is extremely flammable \nThe fourth test tube when we burned the ammonium carbonate it gave off a pungent smell, which is also referred to as cat pee.
