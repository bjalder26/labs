{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"William Daleke","observations1":"bubbles when mixed. splint test extinguished. got colder. ","observations2":"Bubbles when mixed. color changed to yellow. splint test flared and relit. ","observations3":"bubles when mixed. liquid got hotter. splint test popped. ","observations4":"Bubbles when heated. new harsh scent. litmus paper turned blue. ","observations6":"The metal turned black and disintegrated/new solid particulates formed. the liquid turned yellow. ","observationsEthanol":"got hot, produced light. and flame. some blackened residues, formed water on the cold tube. ","observationsMagnesium":"got hot and produced ultraviolet light. left white residue on the material. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In the first test the fire on the stick was extinguished, showing the presence of carbon dioxide. In the second test the fire burned quicker and even re lit, showing the presence of oxygen. In the third test the fire on the stick combusted and made a little pop noise, showing the presence of hydrogen. in the fourth when the substance was heated we tested the gases with litmus paper which turned blue. indicating ammonia. the fourth also put of a harsh scent.
