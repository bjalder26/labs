","observations2":"Bubbles when mixed. color changed to yellow. splint test flared and relit. ","observations3":"bubles when mixed. liquid got hotter. splint test popped. ","observations4":"Bubbles when heated. new harsh scent. litmus paper turned blue. ","observations6":"The metal turned black and disintegrated/new solid particulates formed. the liquid turned yellow. ","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In the first test the fire on the stick was extinguished, showing the presence of carbon dioxide. In the second test the fire burned quicker and even re lit, showing the presence of oxygen. In the third test the fire on the stick combusted and made a little pop noise, showing the presence of hydrogen. in the fourth when the substance was heated we tested the gases with litmus paper which turned blue. indicating ammonia. the fourth also put of a harsh scent.
