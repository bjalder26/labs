The graduated pipets are more accurate than a graduated cylinder, therefore our measurements were much more precise. 2. We also collected a large amount of data which lead to a better range of data providing more accurate results.","frequency":"","colorA":"dark orange","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"green","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"pink/violet","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"yellow","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"red","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"orange/yellow","colorUnknownCobalt":"pink","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
