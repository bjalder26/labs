{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Madison Fisher","q1":"they go in a straight line up","q2":"mostly go up but some come in at angles ","q3":"theres more aplha particles and. they hit the nucleus more ","q4":"because each question gained more alpha particles ","q5":"yes","q6":"because they bounce off each other more ","q7":"they curve away from the nucleus","q8":"they turn away harder ","q9":"20 protons go mostly straight and 100 all turn before or right at the nucleus ","q10":"they just go straight","q11":"the plum pudding atom has multiple nucleus when rutherfords has one ","q12":"becausethe atom had a central core of positively charged particles that were orbited by the negatively charged electrons","q13":"they both have positive charges and like charges repel ","q14":"two elements can be the same but they can have different number of neutrons.","q15":"atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes, element is a substance made up of only one type of atom, each with the same number of protons","q16":"you add the number of protons and neutrons to get the mass","q17":"adding together the number of protons and neutrons and multiplying by 1 amu","q18":"natures mix has a ton of H1 with only one H2 and my mix can be any number mixture of H1 or H2","q19":"0.0115% is the chance of finding that one isotope so id assume itd be pretty hard to find it ","avgsi":"28","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
