","q2":"Yes, I noticed that the alpha particles bounced off the nucleus into different directions a bit farther than with the 20 protons. ","q3":"Because protons are positive, adding more and more protons causes the alpha particles to bounce further away from the nucleus. ","q4":"As I learned more about electric charges in my Chemistry Lecture class, I learned that electric charges with the same charge are likely to repel against each other. So, since alpha particles and protons are positively charged, this causes them to repel or bounce off of each other.   ","q5":"No","q6":"Adding or removing the neutrons doesn't change how the alpha particles move. Since neutrons have no charge, it doesn't affect the direction of alpha particles. ","q7":"In this model, I saw the same with how they moved. Some of the alpha particles would slightly bounce off of the nucleus, but the others went straight through into one direction. ","q8":"Now that this model shows a close up of how the alpha particles move, I've noticed a drastic difference. Not just a few, but all of the alpha particles moved. Even if it didn't get close to the nucleus, they'd all move in different directions away from the nucleus. Only a few were able to get close to the nucleus.","q9":"When I increased the number of protons to 100, none of the alpha particles touched the nucleus. Since the nucleus had so many positively charged protons, the alpha particles didn't stand a chance. ","q10":"All of the alpha particles are going in one direction, which is straight forward. ","q11":"This model is different because there is no nucleus, so all of the alpha particles just go straight through without any bouncing. Thomson hadn't yet discovered protons or neutrons, which are contained inside the nucleus.
