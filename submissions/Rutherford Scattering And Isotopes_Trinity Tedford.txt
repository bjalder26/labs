{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Trinity Tedford","q1":"I noticed that a lot of the alpha particles went in one direction, but if they got close to the nucleus that is when they'd bounce off of it into different directions. ","q2":"Yes, I noticed that the alpha particles bounced off the nucleus into different directions a bit farther than with the 20 protons. ","q3":"Because protons are positive, adding more and more protons causes the alpha particles to bounce further away from the nucleus. ","q4":"As I learned more about electric charges in my Chemistry Lecture class, I learned that electric charges with the same charge are likely to repel against each other. So, since alpha particles and protons are positively charged, this causes them to repel or bounce off of each other.
