{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Morgan Joyner","observations1":"The flame went out instantly","observations2":"As the flame appeared to go out, instantly grew brighter before going out. There was a temperature change (hotter), and a color change (clear-yellow/orange). There were no bubbles seen. ","observations3":"Plethora of bubbles, fire went out immediately after a quick pop. There was a temperature change (hotter), and a strong odor to it.","observations4":"","observations6":"","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We preformed experiments in the class, that provided the pre-lab instructions and information, high following each experiement, would help to identify the element in the experiment."}
