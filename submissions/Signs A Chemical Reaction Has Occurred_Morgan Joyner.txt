{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Morgan Joyner","observations1":"The flame went out instantly","observations2":"As the flame appeared to go out, instantly grew brighter before going out. There was a temperature change (hotter), and a color change (clear-yellow/orange). There were no bubbles seen. ","observations3":"Plethora of bubbles, fire went out immediately after a quick pop. There was a temperature change (hotter), and even after the fire went out the bubbles continued to show","observations4":"litmus paper turned blue and there was a temperature change (hotter), and a strong odor to it.","observations6":"There was a solid formation, and two color changes, in the liquid from a bright clear blue to a murky green color, and in the solid from a grey to brown/black color. Zinc dissolved and liquid became cloudy.","observationsEthanol":"Condensation appeared at the top of the test tube; ice melted until it filled about a quarter of the test tube. Water became hazy (unclear as it continued to be heated by the fire).","observationsMagnesium":"Bright Light, immediate combustion with smoke trail following, leaving residue on the glass.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We preformed experiments in the class, that provided the pre-lab instructions and information, high following each experiement, would help to identify the element in the experiment."}
