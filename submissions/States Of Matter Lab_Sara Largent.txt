Above the melting point they are moving a lot more","q6":"it is about the same at as above the melting point just a little less movement","q7":"373.15 K ","q8":"Just below is very compact at first but then they start knocking into each other and they become more and more spaced out. Just above it they are moving around a lot more","q9":"the spacing is very far apart and they moving slowly.","q10":"i chose oxygen","q11":"as a solid as i added heat the form began to fall apart and as i removed the heat it became compact again. as a liquid as i added heat it became very flowey around and as i took the heat away it became compact again. as a gas it does not really change when i add heat or remove it.","q12":"they all became very far apart the more heat i added, the only difference was how gas was reacting.","q13":"correct, they all did what i said they would.","q14":"states of matter are different by how they react to heat and the cold, they each have their own reaction to it depending on the condensation/boiling point and freezing/ melting point. Like for water the boiling point is 372.15K while it will be different for oxygen which is 90.19K.","q15":"it rises","q16":"because they have a strong chemical bond.","q17":"the pressure rises, the particles become more chaotic ","q18":"as the temperature rise the pressure goes up because it takes up more space as they move around a lot more.","q19":"it continues to rise","q20":"it rises a little bit more, i think because im creating less space for them to go so its creating more pressure.","q21":"it will explode","q22":"the particles will go every where","q23":"i have learned how heat determines pressure and plays a  huge role in it."}
