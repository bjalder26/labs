","q20":"Because their volumes are different, which causes their density to be different too. This difference can cause one of them to float and the other sink.","q21":"B and D float, while A and C sink. I think B and D float because their masses are smaller than the masses of A and C.

In order to make the block that sinks, float, I could stack the blocks that float under it then it'll float too.","q25":"Because their masses are different, which will make their density different and cause them to float or sink.
