Density is defined as mass divided by volume. Although the log has a larger mass compared to the pebble, it also has a much larger volume. This results in the log having lower density than the water, allowing it to float. On the other hand, the pebble, despite having a smaller mass, has a much smaller volume, resulting in a higher density than the water, causing it to sink."}
