","q14":"For mass, if you set it below the mass of water it will float. For volume, if you increase it enough the density starts to decrease and will then float. Increasing the mass past that of water will make it sink. Lowering the volume by itself will increase the density and eventually it will sink. ","q15":"A. Floats B. Floats C. Sinks D. Sinks\nI noticed that though they are all the same weight 5.00 kg some float and others don't. Also as you add blocks the water lever rises. ","q16":"A","q17":"C","q18":"If you stack other clocks on top it will make them sink. ","q19":"Couldn't get one to float that couldn't already, even when trying to displace more water","q20":"The density is differen't between the two, as well as surface area on the bigger block from the water. ","q21":"A and C sink, and B and D are floating. Differences in overall density are the reasons why. The heavier ones sink.","q22":"They all sank","q23":"They all rose to the top","q24":"You can put a heavier block on top of the lighter block, immediately increases the mass and makes it sink. I couldn't get any to float.","q25":"Some sink because though they are all the same size, the masses aren't the same between them all. Those withe the higher mass sink because the density is higher.
