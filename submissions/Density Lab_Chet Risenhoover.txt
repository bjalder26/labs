","q14":"For mass, if you set it below the mass of water it will float. For volume, if you increase it enough the density starts to decrease and will then float. Increasing the mass past that of water will make it sink. Lowering the volume by itself will increase the density and eventually it will sink. ","q15":"A. Floats B. Floats C. Sinks D.
