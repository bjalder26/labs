{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Emily Wideman","q1":"most of the alpha particals are avoiding the nucleus. repelling against it and veering off in different directions slightly","q2":"the avoidance of the alpha particals to the nucleus is much more apparent. the alpha particles now making sharp and wide dodges to stay away from\nthe nucleus.","q3":"some alpha particles are bouncing off the nucleus and flee the opposite direction.","q4":"Alpha particles are positively charged, and protons the same. when objects with like charges come close they repel each other. when the amount of protons is lower the charge isn't as strong, so the alpha particles don't repel with much force. but by increasing the number of protons the charge becomes stronger and clashes with the alpha particles, causing the alpha particles to have a more dramatic repel, going in sharp directions to avoid the protons.","q5":"i dont think so.","q6":"perhaps because neutrons are neutral and have no charge. so the dont affect the alpha particles in any way","q7":"they veer off slightly, edging past it","q8":"they veer off dramatically, bouncing off of it without actually touching it.","q9":"they bounce back so dramatically they don't even make it past the nucleus.","q10":"straight through.","q11":"firstly i dont see any protons. just scattered electrons. so the alpha particals are going through becaus they dont have anything to repel.","q12":"because it didn't take into account that the nucleus of an atom is a dense ball of protons and neutrons so there was nothing for the particles to deflect.","q13":"because both alpha particles and the nucleus have a positive charge, so they repel each other.","q14":"isotope is a 2 or more of the same elementary, same amount of protons, only differing in the number of neutrons, causing the atomic mass to rise while the atomic number stays the same.","q15":"both atoms and isotopes are from the same elements, and isotopes are atoms, just with different masses. Elements can not be broken down while atoms and isotopes can be broken down into particles.","q16":"you would subtract the protons from the mass number leaving you with the number of neutrons.","q17":"simply add the atomic number (protons) to the amount of neutrons.","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
