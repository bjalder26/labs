{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Emily Wideman","q1":"most of the alpha particals are avoiding the nucleus. repelling against it and veering off in different directions slightly","q2":"the avoidance of the alpha particals to the nucleus is much more apparent. the alpha particles now making sharp and wide dodges to stay away from\nthe nucleus.","q3":"some alpha particles are bouncing off the nucleus and flee the opposite direction.","q4":"Alpha particles are positively charged, and protons the same. when objects with like charges come close they repel each other. when the amount of protons is lower the charge isn't as strong, so the alpha particles don't repel with much force. but by increasing the number of protons the charge becomes stronger and clashes with the alpha particles, causing the alpha particles to have a more dramatic repel, going in sharp directions to avoid the protons.","q5":"","q6":"","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
