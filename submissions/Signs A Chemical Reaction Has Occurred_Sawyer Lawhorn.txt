{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Sawyer Lawhorn","observations1":"Bubbles, releases cloud that put out open flame, results uncertain, burning splint was dropped in test tube mid experiment.","observations2":"bubbles, open flame grew when placed near it.","observations3":"bubbles, a loud pop was heard.","observations4":"released bad odor, changed the litmus paper to a blue color.","observations6":"change of color, silver to black.","observationsEthanol":"visible flame, release of heat, produced carbon dioxide and water vapor.","observationsMagnesium":"very bright light, leaves behind powder.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"1. The open flame from the splint was put out.\n2. The open flame from the splint grew when held over the test tube.\n3. A pop could be heard from the release of hydrogen.\n4. The ammonia changes the litmus paper to the color blue."}
