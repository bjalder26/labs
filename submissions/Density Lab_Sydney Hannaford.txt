{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Sydney Hannaford","q1":"As you increase the mass of the block the volume also increases. The more you increase the mass of the block the more the volume increases, and when you decrease the mass of the block the volume also decreases. ","q2":"The block always floats. The more you move the slider the bigger the block will get.In the intro the block is less dense than the water, no matter how big you make the block.","q3":"When you decrease the mass of the block the water volume decreases, but if you increase the mass of the block the volume of the water will increase. ","q4":"When you decrease the volume using the slider the mass of the block also decreases.","q5":"The more you decrease the volume the lower the water gets because the block also decreases mass. ","q6":"Even when decreasing the volume as far as the slider will go the block never sinks. ","q7":"No, the aluminum block never floats when adjusting the volume or the mass. The water is less dense than the aluminum. ","q8":"The more you increase the mass of the aluminum the more the volume increases. ","q9":"No, the ice never sinks when adjusting the mass or the volume. The ice always floats, because it is less dense than the water. ","q10":"The more you decrease the volume of the ice the more the mass decreases with it. ","massice":"9.19","volice":"10.00","denIce":".919","q12":"I used the mass of .92 and the volume of 1.00 and the dnesity it .92. The density is greater the second time when i used different mass and volume. ","q13":"Ice always floats because it is always less dense than liquid water. ","q14":"When doing a custom block it will float if the mass is smaller and the volume is larger, and it will sink if the mass is greater or equal to the volume. ","q15":"When I put block A in the water it sinks and has a mass of 5.00 kg. When I put block B in the water it floats but it is also 5.00kg. When I put block C in the water it immediately sinks it also weighs 5.00kg. When I put block D in the water it also sinks and is 5.00kg. Block A,C,and D sank to the bottom but the appearance of the blocks are small. Block B floats but is a lot bigger than the other blocks. The volume of the water rose every time I added in a block even if was just a small change.","q16":"Block B now sinks when you change the mass. ","q17":"When changing the mass blocks A and C now float but D still sinks. ","q18":"Yes when you put block A,C, or D on block B which usually floats it would sink.
