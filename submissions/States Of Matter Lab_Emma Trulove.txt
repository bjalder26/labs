","p2":"I think the molecules in a liquid will be slightly lose and very little spaced out with vibration movement. ","p3":"I think the molecules in a gas will be spaced out and all over the place. They will have a floating movement. ","q1":"The molecules are packed together with tiny holes throughout. It also appears that they have a vibration movement to them. ","q2":"The thermometer is showing 556 K.","q3":"The molecules are no longer packed together and are spinning all over the place.","q4":"The melting/freezing point of water in kelvin is 273-373.","q5":"Below its melting point there are tiny holes between the molecules, tiny vibration movement and still close together. Above melting point the molecules are starting to space out more and doing spinning vibration movement.
