{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Jaycee Patton","q1":"The alpha particles move in a straight line generally.","q2":"Yes, they start coming from different directions.","q3":"It seems like they are going faster in different directions.","q4":"They became more positively charged as you add protons to it which changes the reaction of it.","q5":"no","q6":"When you change the number of neutrons, it doesn't seem to cause the particles to travel differently. This is probably due to the neutrons not having a positive or negative charge.","q7":"When the protons are at 20, the nucleus is smaller and the particles seem to be closer to the nucleus (not touching).","q8":"They move the same as the 20 protons did, but the nucleus is larger.","q9":"The nucleus is much larger and the alpha particles move farther away from the nucleus.","q10":"a straight line path","q11":"The rutherford simulation portrayed the particles as going in numerous directions.","q12":"Rutherford realized that a lot of the particles were deflected with the gold foil experiment rather than continuing in a straight line.","q13":"Most of the alpha particles are positively charged.","q14":"the same element where atoms have the same amount of protons which also means the same atomic number and electrons, but differ in the number of neutrons which causes a different mass number to occur for each isotope ","q15":"an element is a substance made of of a type of atom. An Atom is the smallest part of that element and it consists of either a positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral charged atom. An isotope is an atom with the same amount of protons and electrons but different neutrons.","q16":"You can figure out the name of the isotope by looking at the number of protons. The number of protons and the mass number are synonymous with one another, so however many protons there are, that is the mass number.","q17":"As you add neutrons to the isotope, the mass number changes.","q18":"Natures mix is already chosen for you. My mix is the one that you edit.","q19":"This is false because the probability of finding one isotope of an element and it being the same doesn't seem possible as all elements are unique and they vary.","avgsi":"29","q21":"To check if Bill's idea is correct, you can calculate the average atomic mass of silicon to see if it actually had equal parts of each isotope. Then you could follow that up by comparing it to the average atomic mass of silicon.","avgfemass":"55.7921","q22":"The average atomic mass of iron is (55.7921) amu. This value is very close to the value on the periodic table (55.845 amu).","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"I don't understand this question."}
