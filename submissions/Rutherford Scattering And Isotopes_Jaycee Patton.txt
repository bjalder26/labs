{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Jaycee Patton","q1":"The alpha particles move in a straight line generally.","q2":"Yes, they start coming from different directions.","q3":"It seems like they are going faster in different directions.","q4":"They became more positively charged as you add protons to it which changes the reaction of it.","q5":"no","q6":"When you change the number of neutrons, it doesn't seem to cause the particles to travel differently. This is probably due to the neutrons not having a positive or negative charge.","q7":"When the protons are at 20, the nucleus is smaller and the particles seem to be closer to the nucleus (not touching).","q8":"They move the same as the 20 protons did, but the nucleus is larger.","q9":"The nucleus is much larger and the alpha particles move farther away from the nucleus.","q10":"a straight line path","q11":"The rutherford simulation portrayed the particles as going in numerous directions.","q12":"Rutherford realized that a lot of the particles were deflected with the gold foil experiment rather than continuing in a straight line.","q13":"Most of the alpha particles are positively charged.","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
