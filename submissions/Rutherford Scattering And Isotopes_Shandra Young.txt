{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Shandra Young","q1":"I set the number of protons to 20 and clicked the blue button to start firing alpha particles at the gold foil. The traces show that the alpha particles pass near the nucleus. Even when the alpha particles are directly in line with the nucleus, they avoid hitting it. This means most alpha particles go through the atom without being deflected because, according to the nuclear model, much of the atom's space is empty.","q2":"The nucleus at 60 protons, affects how alpha particles move. The increased positive charge in the nucleus causes the alpha particles to be deflected more. This means they are more likely to scatter at larger angles when they get close to the atom.","q3":"As I increased the number of protons in the gold foil, the alpha particles were deflected at larger angles than before. An increase in the positive charge within the nucleus exerts a significantly stronger electrostatic force on the positively charged alpha particles. This results in more pronounced deflections at larger angles and enhances the likelihood of the particles bouncing back.","q4":"This phenomenon arises from the significantly stronger positive charge in gold atoms, which generates a powerful repulsive force against alpha particles.","q5":"Increasing the number of protons in a nucleus enhances its positive charge. This stronger positive charge in the nucleus produces a significant repulsive force on positively charged alpha particles. Consequently, alpha particles experienced considerable deflection as they approached a nucleus with a higher proton count.","q6":"Increasing the number of protons in the gold foil leads to a greater diversion of alpha particles at larger angles compared to the initial scenario. This event occurs because the enhanced positive charge of the gold atoms generates a stronger repulsive force between the alpha particles and the gold atoms.","q7":"When you click the red/gray sphere and set the number of protons to 20, I observed that the alpha particles are predominantly deflected away from the nucleus. A small number undergoes significant deflections or even bounces back directly toward the source. This clearly demonstrates that the nucleus is small, dense, and positively charged, which leads to strong repulsion against the positively charged alpha particles.","q8":"The majority of alpha particles pass through the atom with minimal deflection. However, a small percentage experience notable deflection, particularly when they approach the nucleus closely. This is due to the nucleus's positive charge being concentrated in a small, dense area, which generates a powerful repulsive force against the positively charged alpha particles that come near it.","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
