{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Shandra Young","q1":"I set the number of protons to 20 and clicked the blue button to start firing alpha particles at the gold foil. The traces show that the alpha particles pass near the nucleus. Even when the alpha particles are directly in line with the nucleus, they avoid hitting it. This means most alpha particles go through the atom without being deflected because, according to the nuclear model, much of the atom's space is empty.","q2":"If a nucleus has 60 protons, it will affect how alpha particles move. The increased positive charge in the nucleus will cause the alpha particles to be deflected more. This means they are more likely to scatter at larger angles when they get close to the atom.","q3":"When you increase the number of protons in the gold foil, the alpha particles are deflected at larger angles than before. An increase in the positive charge within the nucleus exerts a significantly stronger electrostatic force on the positively charged alpha particles. This results in more pronounced deflections at larger angles and enhances the likelihood of the particles bouncing back.","q4":"This phenomenon arises from the significantly stronger positive charge in gold atoms, which generates a powerful repulsive force against alpha particles.","q5":"","q6":"","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
