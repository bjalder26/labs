{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Junior Sandoval","q1":"they just scatter everywhere.","q2":"Some particles bounces off the nucleus.","q3":"it goes on a slow pace but when it bounces off the nucleus it scatters off faster. ","q4":"It attracts the particles more. ","q5":"yes\n","q6":"It goes on into a slower pace but goes to the side fasters.","q7":"they just go up and bounces of the nucleus.","q8":"the particles that do deflect don't really hit the nucleus.","q9":"When there are 20 protons it will deflect closer but, with 100 protons it deflects father away.","q10":"it goes straight through the positive charged pudding.","q11":"it just shows in lines where the alpha particles go.","q12":"so that we could trace it even faster and clearer.","q13":"because of the charges.","q14":"isotope is the where they are the same amount of protons with different neutrons.
