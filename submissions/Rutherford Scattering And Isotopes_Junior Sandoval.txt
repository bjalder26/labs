","q5":"yes\n","q6":"It goes on into a slower pace but goes to the side fasters.","q7":"they just go up and bounces of the nucleus.","q8":"the particles that do deflect don't really hit the nucleus.","q9":"When there are 20 protons it will deflect closer but, with 100 protons it deflects father away.","q10":"it goes straight through the positive charged pudding.","q11":"it just shows in lines where the alpha particles go.","q12":"so that we could trace it even faster and clearer.","q13":"because of the charges.","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
