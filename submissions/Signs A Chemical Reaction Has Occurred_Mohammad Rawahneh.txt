{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Mohammad Rawahneh","observations1":"it got hot not to the hand touch and no sound was produced from the tube no color change","observations2":"when lowering the wood into the tube a bob sound was produced from the tube after the color change into orange and got hot the touch","observations3":"a sound came from the test tube and the Magnesium turned white the test tube became hot no color change a lot of gas was prudes from the reaction ","observations4":"the paper turned into a bule color ","observations6":"the zinc stuck togher and the color turned black for the zinc also the zinc sunk to the bottom ","observationsEthanol":"the ice melted the flame burnt out after 1 min the flame was alomest invisible ","observationsMagnesium":"the magnesium got brightnher and started to smoke and the ash was white ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":"we were able to know the reaction by the reactions of the chemicals. the different chemicals all created a different reaction. the oxygen reignited tghe flame while the carbon dixode extinguished the flames. Hydrogen made the flame pop as if the chemicals were over stemulating the chemicals. The ammonia turned litmus papaer blue. "}
