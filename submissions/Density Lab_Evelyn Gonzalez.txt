","q14":"The mass being low makes the custom block float. The mass being high makes the custom block sink. ","q15":"I notice that they all weigh 5.00 kg but some of them sink and other ones float.

When the blocks combine, their density overpowers the density of the water and they sink. ","q19":"Yes, you can make a block float that would normally sink by stacking multiple blocks on top of each other or by increasing its volume or decreasing density. ","q20":"Block B has a lower density than the water it's in which is why it floats. Block D has a higher density than the water which is why it sinks. ","q21":"Block A sinks, block B floats, block C sinks, block D floats. They float because they are less dense than water. The ones that sink are denser. ","q22":"When the volume is decreased to 1.50 L, all of the blocks sink because their density is higher. ","q23":"They all float. ","q24":"Yes, putting different blocks on top of each other can make a block sink that would normally float or a block float that would normally sink.","q25":"Because some of them have a larger density than the water which causes them to sink and the ones that have a smaller density, float.
