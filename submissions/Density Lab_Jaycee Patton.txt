After dividing it, I got 0.919. It is less dense than the first calculated density.","q13":"The ice is less dense than water. If the density of the ice were to surpass the water than it would sink, however, there is more water which makes it less dense than the water itself.","q14":"The mass makes the block sink. As the mass increases in size, the block begins to sink. The volume makes the block float.","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":"","q24":"","q25":"","mass1a":"","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
