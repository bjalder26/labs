After dividing it, I got 0.919. It is less dense than the first calculated density.","q13":"The ice is less dense than water. If the density of the ice were to surpass the water than it would sink, however, there is more water which makes it less dense than the water itself.","q14":"The mass makes the block sink. As the mass increases in size, the block begins to sink. The volume makes the block float.","q15":"A floats because it isn't touching the bottom, even if it isn't above the water level. B floats, C sinks, and D sinks. The smaller the size of the block, the more they sink.","q16":"A sinks the second time.","q17":"C floats when the mass is adjusted.","q18":"When you put a block that normally sinks on top of a block that normally floats, it will cause it to sink.","q19":"A block that normally sinks won't float because even when you put something under it, it is still touching the closest thing to the surface and never actually proceeds to float. It might be at a higher volume, but it is still as far down as it can be.","q20":"The molecules of block D are packed more tightly together meaning that it is more dense. The object that is more dense will sink. There is not enough water to support the mass of the smaller block because of it's density.","q21":"Blocks D and B float whereas A and C sink. The blocks with more mass and the same volume sink.","q22":"All of the blocks including B and D sink to the bottom.","q23":"All of the blocks float.","q24":"When you put a block that floats on top of another block that floats, they still float. However, if you put a block that sinks on top of a floating block, it will cause the floating block to sink due to the weight that is put on the block.

The log floats because it has a lower density because of its mass and volume. The volume of an object is how much space that object occupies. A log doesn't occupy that much space due to the hole in the middle. That causes it to float. whereas a pebble it has a smaller mass, but it occupies more of the space in it which makes it more dense than the log."}
