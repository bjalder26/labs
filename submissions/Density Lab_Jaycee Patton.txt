After dividing it, I got 0.919. It is less dense than the first calculated density.","q13":"The ice is less dense than water. If the density of the ice were to surpass the water than it would sink, however, there is more water which makes it less dense than the water itself.","q14":"The mass makes the block sink. As the mass increases in size, the block begins to sink. The volume makes the block float.","q15":"A floats because it isn't touching the bottom, even if it isn't above the water level. B floats, C sinks, and D sinks. The smaller the size of the block, the more they sink.","q16":"A sinks the second time.","q17":"C floats when the mass is adjusted.","q18":"When you put a block that normally sinks on top of a block that normally floats, it will cause it to sink.","q19":"A block that normally sinks won't float because even when you put something under it, it is still touching the closest thing to the surface and never actually proceeds to float. It might be at a higher volume, but it is still as far down as it can be.","q20":"The molecules of block D are packed more tightly together meaning th","q21":"","q22":"","q23":"","q24":"","q25":"","mass1a":"","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
