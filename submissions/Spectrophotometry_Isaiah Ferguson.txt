This likely led to the percent difference of the absorbance of the solution to be higher than expected.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"orange","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"green","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"violet","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"yellow","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"red","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"yellow","colorUnknownCobalt":"violet","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
