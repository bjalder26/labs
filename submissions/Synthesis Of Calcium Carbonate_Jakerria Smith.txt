While heating it, particles in the solution started to rapidly move. Condensation started to form on the edges of the beaker. There is a solid forming at the bottom of the beaker. After heating, the solution turned clear.

We made sure to scrap all off the solid out of the beaker and tried our best not to lose any of the solid. "}
