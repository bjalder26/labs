When we got 0.9 something was wrong, and it was made known to us that we needed to rotate the cuvette and the spectrophotometer, and doing so gave us the expected range. We also used adequate procedures and ensured that we knew exactly what we were supposed to be doing.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"orange","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"green","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"violet","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"yellow","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"red","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"yellow","colorUnknownCobalt":"violet","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
