I believe the reasons why my percent error was less than 20% was mostly because we used the 10 mL graduated pipets. Using the graduated pipets allowed the measurements to be more precise. The other reason why my result was less than 20% was because of the multiple measurements used during this experiment. It allowed for the measurements to balance out.","frequency":"5.71e14","colorA":"orange","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"green","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"violet","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"yellow","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"red","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"yellow","colorUnknownCobalt":"purple","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
