{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Kapatrick Fleming","p1":"The molecules will be closely packed together in a fixed arrangement, tightly bonded to one another.","p2":"The molecules will be more loosely arranged compared to a solid, allowing them to slide past one another while still remaining in close proximity.","p3":"The molecules will be widely spaced apart and move independently of one another, with little to no interaction. ","q1":"The solid phase of water exemplifies the properties of matter in a low-energy state. They vibrate slightly in place rather than moving freely. ","q2":"You can see the temperature readings increase.","q3":"As heat is added and the temperature rises, the energy of the molecules increases, causing them to vibrate more vigorously. The molecules gain enough energy to overcome some of the attractive forces that hold them in their fixed positions. ","q4":"The melting/freezing point of water in Kelvin is 273.15 K.","q5":"The spacing between the molecules is minimal, reflecting the orderly and rigid structure characteristic of solids. below the melting point, the molecules are tightly packed and vibrate, while above it, they become more widely spaced and move fluidly.","q6":"The molecules are relatively close together, but they are not as tightly packed as in the solid state. This keeps the molecules linked but not fixed in position.","q7":"The boiling/condensation point of water in Kelvin is 373.15 K.","q8":"The molecules are gaining energy and moving more vigorously, but they remain in the liquid phase. ","q9":"The molecules are widely spaced apart, much farther than in either the liquid or solid states. The water molecules in the gas phase are in constant, rapid motion. ","q10":"Oxygen","q11":"Molecules are closely packed together in a fixed arrangement. The particles vibrate in place but do not have the freedom to move past each other, resulting in a rigid structure.","q12":"Particle motion and spacing apply to both substances, the differences in molecular structure and intermolecular forces lead to distinct behaviors and properties in each state of matter.","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
