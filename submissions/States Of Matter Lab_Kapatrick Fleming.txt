","q1":"The solid phase of water exemplifies the properties of matter in a low-energy state. They vibrate slightly in place rather than moving freely. ","q2":"You can see the temperature readings increase.","q3":"As heat is added and the temperature rises, the energy of the molecules increases, causing them to vibrate more vigorously. The molecules gain enough energy to overcome some of the attractive forces that hold them in their fixed positions. ","q4":"The melting/freezing point of water in Kelvin is 273.15 K.","q5":"The spacing between the molecules is minimal, reflecting the orderly and rigid structure characteristic of solids. below the melting point, the molecules are tightly packed and vibrate, while above it, they become more widely spaced and move fluidly.","q6":"The molecules are relatively close together, but they are not as tightly packed as in the solid state. This keeps the molecules linked but not fixed in position.","q7":"The boiling/condensation point of water in Kelvin is 373.15 K.","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
