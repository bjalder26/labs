{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Antonio Yocco","observations1":"When we put the sodium bicarbonate in the vinegar, it started to bubble. When we went to insert the wood split it put the stick out. No color or temperature change was observed.","observations2":"When we put the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide, it turned an orangish-brown color and began to bubble. When we inserted the wooden split it reignited, and the temp of the test tube rose.","observations3":"when we dropped the magnesium ribbon into the hydrochloric acid, the magnesium ribbon began to dissolve. As the magnesium strip was dissolving, the temp of the test tube rose, and the color of the hydrochloric acid turned white while it was dissolving. When we did the splint test it created a loud popping sound. ","observations4":"As we burned the ammonium carbonate, it began to dissolve and began to release a pungent smell. When we did the litmus test, the paper turned blue.","observations6":"a solid formed that reddish brown color which would be copper forming. The liquid lost its blue color and turned clear ","observationsEthanol":"The temperature of the test tube rose. Water condensation formed on the outside of the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"When we lit the magnesium with the Bunsen burner, it glowed a bright white color before turning to ash in the watch glass.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
