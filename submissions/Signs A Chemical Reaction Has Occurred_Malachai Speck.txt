{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Malachai Speck","observations1":"Bubbles formed, pressure built up when covered, put out flame, put out carbon dioxide.","observations2":"Color change to yellow, heat change, reignited embers to flame, produced oxygen.","observations3":"Bubbles formed, got hotter, caused a popping sound with splint test, put out flame, produced hydrogen.","observations4":"Pungent smell, evaporation of chemical color change of paper to purple, produced ammonia.","observations6":"Color change, zinc somewhat dissolves.","observationsEthanol":"Flame from ethanol. Condensation formed and ice melted.","observationsMagnesium":"Bright white light, lasted for a second and then burned out.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"The flame was put out in the first test tube due to carbon dioxide. The flame was reignited in the second tube due to oxygen, because it fuels fire. Hydrogen will cause a pop, and that's what happened in the third test tube. Then the fourth one created ammonia to make the litmus paper change color."}
