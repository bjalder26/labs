{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Adrienne Vaughan","q1":"Most of the alpha particles move on one path that doesn’t really change.","q2":"Yes, some particles start to curve and scatter around","q3":"They seemed even more all over the place some particles were even touching others. ","q4":"Like charges repel. Because of that, I believe the more like charged protons present caused them to repel each other and move in many directions.","q5":"No. The number of neutrons seemed to have no affect.","q6":"Because they are neutrally charged. ","q7":"They seem to still move in the same straight path but they look as if they move around or away from the nucleus.","q8":"They seemed to be be even more repelled away from the nucleus.","q9":"With 20 protons there was a bit of a repell, but once more protons were added the repell from the nucleus became greater.","q10":"The particles are moving in a straight consistent path.","q11":"It’s different because the Rutherford simulation showed how the particles travel from the gold foil. ","q12":"","q13":"The nucleus has the same charge causing them to repel. ","q14":"An isotope is atom that has the same amount of protons as another atom of the same element but they have a different number of neutrons. The different number of neutrons affects the atomic mass. Isotopes can have different numbers of neutrons and electrons but keep the same atomic number.","q15":"1.  An atom is the smallest unit of an element 2. An isotope is a variation of an atom\n3. Elements are made up of one type of atom\n \nThe comparison seems to be that they are all “related” in a sense as said above elements are made up of one type of atom, atoms are what make up and element and the isotope is the variation of the atom\n","q16":"You would have to add the number of protons and neutrons to get your mass number and use the number of protons to determine the element.","q17":"You would check your periodic table to find the number of protons.
