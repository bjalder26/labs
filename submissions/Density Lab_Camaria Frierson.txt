Ice floats in liquid water for this reason.","q14":"A lower mass with a higher volume will make the custom block float, a higher mass with a lower volume will make a custom block sink.","q15":"The only block that floats is block B, all of the other blocks sink.","q16":"None","q17":"block A and block C now float.","q18":"When stacking multiple blocks on top of block B it makes the block sink instead of float.","q19":"When I stack one block on top of block B it makes it float.","q20":"The density of the blocks is what makes them sink or float.","q21":"blocks b and d float and blocks c and a sink.
