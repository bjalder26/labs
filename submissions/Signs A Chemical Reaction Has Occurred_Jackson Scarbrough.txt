{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Jackson Scarbrough","observations1":"It immediately caused the flame to go out and bubbles and smoke appeared. The test tube got warm.","observations2":"Bubbles formed, the test tube got very warm, and the splint relit as it entered the test tube.","observations3":"Bubbles before and after the splint test. The test caused a pop and immediately put out the flame. The color changed to a bluish tint and got warm.","observations4":"The litmus paper turned blue. The ammonium bicarbonate displayed a repulsive odor.","observations6":"The copper chloride turned murky and the zinc changed to a blackish color.","observationsEthanol":"A flame was lit, and condensation was formed on the outside of the test tube. ","observationsMagnesium":"It caught on fire and was very bright. Smoke was formed and a paper like residue was left.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were given the results of different gases involved in the test and we saw similar results. Therefore, we were able to determine which gas was which by how they reacted. "}
