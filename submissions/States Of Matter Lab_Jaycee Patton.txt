It fits to the shape of the container it is in.","p3":"Atoms are spread out and is not visible. It is the most freely moving state of matter.","q1":"It is compact and not moving very much.","q2":"kelvin","q3":"The molecules begin to move more freely and there is more space between each molecule.","q4":"273.1 K","q5":"Below the melting point the molecules are more compact and it doesn't move as freely. It is more of a solid. once it is above the melting point it becomes a liquid moving more freely and spreading out.","q6":"","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"","q11":"","q12":"","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
