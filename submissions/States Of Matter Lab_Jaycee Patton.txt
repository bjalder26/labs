{"labName":"States Of Matter Lab","userName":"Jaycee Patton","p1":"A solid is compact and atoms are tightly fit together.","p2":"Less rigid than a solid but more rigid than a gas. It fits to the shape of the container it is in.","p3":"Atoms are spread out and is not visible. It is the most freely moving state of matter.","q1":"It is compact and not moving very much.","q2":"kelvin","q3":"The molecules begin to move more freely and there is more space between each molecule.","q4":"273.1 K","q5":"Below the melting point the molecules are more compact and it doesn't move as freely. It is more of a solid. once it is above the melting point it becomes a liquid moving more freely and spreading out.","q6":"The water is all towards the bottom of the container. It fits to the shape of the container. The molecules are slightly moving in circles but they don't move to different places in the container. They are also moving at a faster speed.","q7":"373.15","q8":"There isn't much movement below its boiling point and not much pressure either. The particles are more tightly packed together.","q9":"The water as it turns to a gas begins to move more freely. it is spa","q10":"Argon","q11":"The gas is freely moving with no definite shape or volume. It is moving a lot with a bunch of space.\nAs a liquid it is more compact and there isn't as much space between the particles. There is a definite volume but not a definite shape to liquid.","q12":"The liquid and gas form of argon was pretty similar to that of water, however, the solid was differen","q13":"","q14":"","q15":"The pressure increases.","q16":"The substances are attracted to the particles that are pumped in causing them to stick together.","q17":"As the solid begins to heat up the particles begin to move more freely as well as more pressure. They are not as compact as they were before.","q18":"The temperature has to rise to make the pressure of the substance increase.","q19":"The particles begin to move in a circular motion faster. The particles also hit each other harder with pressure than before.","q20":"It makes it bounce around more because there is less space. There is also more pressure.","q21":"The container explodes and the lid pops off.","q22":"They all start flying out of the container.","q23":""}
