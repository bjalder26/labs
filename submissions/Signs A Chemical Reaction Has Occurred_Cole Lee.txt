{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Cole Lee","observations1":"Bubbles formed as the reaction occurred. The gas extinguished the flame during the splint test. The bottom of the test tube did feel slightly colder as well.","observations2":"The liquid turned from clear to a yellow color. The solution slightly bubbled. The gas made the splint glow during the splint test. Created a smell that was not pleasant.","observations3":"Bubbled during the reaction. Created a loud pop or squeak during the splint test. The solution also changed from clear to a brown-yellow color.","observations4":"The powder slowly disappeared. When the red litmus paper was exposed to the end of the test tube it turned blue in color. Created a horrendous odor.","observations6":"Solid changed color to a black-brown color. The solution turned from a transparent blue to a translucent yellow.","observationsEthanol":"Once the Ethanol was lit the ice within the test tube placed over it melted and a precipitant formed on the outside of the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"The magnesium glowed a bright white color and then burned out. What was left was a white residue.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
