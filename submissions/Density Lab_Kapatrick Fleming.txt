","q5":"When the volume of the block is reduced, it shows less water. ","q6":"No","q7":"Regardless of how you adjust the mass and volume of the aluminum block, it will not float. ","q8":"As you increase the mass of the aluminum block, the volume will change in accordance with its density. ","q9":"By either increasing the mass of the ice or decreasing its volume, it is possible for the ice to sink.","q10":"When you decrease the volume of ice while keeping the substance itself constant, the mass of the ice does not change unless you actively remove some of the ice. ","massice":"0.5","volice":"0.54","denIce":"0.92","q12":"When comparing the calculated density from both scenarios, the density remains constant at approximately 0.92 kg/L. This demonstrates that regardless of the mass and volume chosen, as long as the ice is the same material, the density will remain consistent.","q13":"Since the density of ice is less than that of liquid water, it means that for the same volume, ice will have a lower mass compared to an equal volume of water.","q14":"When the custom block has a density that is less than the density of water (1.00 kg/L), it will float. This is because, like ice, the block displaces a volume of water that weighs more than the block itself, allowing it to stay on the surface. The lower the density of the block, the greater its ability to float.","q15":"Floating Blocks: These blocks are less dense than water (B).\nSinking Blocks: These blocks are denser than water (A,C and D).","q16":"Stay the same block B","q17":"Block A,C and B","q18":"By stacking blocks without adjusting the mass, it is possible to make a block that normally floats sink by increasing the overall weight.","q19":"Increase the mass ","q20":"The key reason one block floats while the other sinks, despite having the same mass, lies in their densities, which are a function of their respective volumes. Block B’s lower density allows it to float, while Block D’s higher density causes it to sink.","q21":"Blocks that float: B and D \nBlocks that sink: A and C ","q22":"","q23":"","q24":"","q25":"","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.5","den1a":"3.5","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":"0.40","vol1b":"0.4","den1b":"1","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5.00","vol1d":"5","den1d":"1","sub1d":"Water","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"2.8","den1e":"1","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"18.00","vol2a":"1.59","den2a":"11.32","sub2a":"Lead","mass2b":"10.80","vol2b":"4","den2b":"2.7","sub2b":"Glass","mass2c":"2.70","vol2c":"1","den2c":"2.7","sub2c":"Glass","mass2d":"18.00","vol2d":"4","den2d":"4.5","sub2d":"Titanium","mass2e":"44.80","vol2e":"5","den2e":"8.96","sub2e":"Copper","mass3a":"2.85","vol3a":"2.85","den3a":"1","sub3a":"Water","mass3b":"6.00","vol3b":"6","den3b":"1","sub3b":"Water","mass3c":"23.40","vol3c":"3","den3c":"7.8","sub3c":"Steel","mass3d":"2.00","vol3d":"2","den3d":"1","sub3d":"Water","mass3e":"6.00","vol3e":"6","den3e":"1","sub3e":"Water","q26":""}
