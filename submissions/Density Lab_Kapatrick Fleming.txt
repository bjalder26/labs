According to Archimedes’ principle, an object will float if it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its weight.","q14":"When the custom block has a density that is less than the density of water (1.00 kg/L), it will float. The lower the density of the block, the greater its ability to float.If the custom block has a density greater than that of water, it will sink.
