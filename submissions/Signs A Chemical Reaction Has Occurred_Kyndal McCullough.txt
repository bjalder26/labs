{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Kyndal McCullough","observations1":"After mixing the solution, it bubbled over. Then when we added the splint the flame went out. The tube was cold to the touch. ","observations2":"Once we lit the splint and put it in the tube, the hydrogen peroxide bubbled, and the stick sparked again. The tube then became hot. ","observations3":"Whenever we dropped the ribbon in the tube, it started to bubble and heat up. Then we put the ignited splint in the tube, and it made a popping sound and extinguished, causing the tube to heat up more. ","observations4":"The litmus paper turned blue after being exposed to the ammonium carbonate gas. The test tube became very hot and let off a pungent odor. ","observations6":"When we added zinc to the copper chloride, the zinc turned black and clumped together. Later the color of the chloride turned clear when it started off as blue. ","observationsEthanol":"Once we lit the Ethyl Alcohol on fire and held the test tube over it, the ice in the tube melted, and the tube became warmer. ","observationsMagnesium":"We lit the bunsen burner and then held the ribbon over it, causing it to ignite and burn and glow. There was a burn residue on the watch glass.
