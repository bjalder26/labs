They are not moving around freely, but they are slightly vibrating in place. The structure looks stable and rigid, which matches how ice behaves in real life.","q2":"The thermometer is showing the Celsius temperature scale. You can tell because the temperature values are marked in degrees Celsius (°C), which is commonly used in scientific experiments.","q3":"As the temperature increases, the water molecules begin to move faster and spread farther apart. The molecules start to vibrate more intensely and slide past each other, transitioning from a more rigid, organized structure to a less structured, more fluid movement as the solid turns into a liquid.","q4":"The melting/freezing point of water in Kelvin is 273.15 K. This is equivalent to 0°C, which is the temperature at which water changes from solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to solid (freezing).","q5":"Below the melting point, the water molecules are closely packed in a rigid, organized structure, only vibrating slightly in place. Above the melting point, the molecules move faster, spread farther apart, and begin to slide past each other, transitioning into a more fluid, less structured arrangement as the solid turns into a liquid. The spacing increases, and the motion becomes more dynamic above the melting point.","q6":"When water is a liquid, the molecules are close together but not in a fixed arrangement. They move freely and slide past each other, allowing the liquid to flow. The molecules still vibrate but have more freedom to move around compared to a solid, giving the liquid a more dynamic and fluid structure.","q7":"The boiling/condensation point of water in Kelvin is 373.15 K. This is equivalent to 100°C, which is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a gas (boiling) or from a gas to a liquid (condensation).","q8":"Below the boiling point, the water molecules are close together and move freely, sliding past each other in the liquid state. As the temperature approaches the boiling point, the molecules move faster and gain more energy. Above the boiling point, the water molecules are spread further apart and move much more rapidly, transitioning into a gas. The molecules in the gas state move in all directions, bouncing off each other and the container walls, creating a more chaotic motion.","q9":"When water is a gas, the molecules are widely spaced and move very quickly in all directions. They have a lot of energy, bouncing off each other and the walls of the container. The molecules are far apart compared to their arrangement in liquid or solid states, and their motion is much more chaotic and fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q10":"I selected carbon dioxide (CO₂) to investigate.","q11":"Solid: In the solid state, the carbon dioxide molecules are tightly packed in a rigid structure. They vibrate slightly in place but do not move freely.\n\nLiquid: In the liquid state, the molecules are still close together, but they move past one another more freely. The motion is faster compared to the solid state, but the molecules are still more organized than in the gas state.\n\nGas: In the gas state, the molecules are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. They bounce off each other and the walls of the container, creating a very chaotic and energetic motion. The spacing between the molecules is much greater than in the solid or liquid states.","q12":"The motion and spacing of the carbon dioxide molecules are similar to water in each state in that both substances follow the same general principles of behavior:\n\nSolid: Both water and carbon dioxide have molecules that are tightly packed in a fixed structure and vibrate in place. However, carbon dioxide’s solid state appears less organized compared to water's, and it forms a more irregular pattern.\n\nLiquid: In both water and carbon dioxide as liquids, the molecules are close together but move past each other more freely. The motion in both is more fluid, though carbon dioxide in liquid form exists only under high pressure or low temperature, while water can remain liquid under more typical conditions.\n\nGas: In the gas state, both substances have molecules that are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. The key difference is that carbon dioxide gas has molecules that are less energetic compared to water vapor, meaning carbon dioxide molecules move more slowly at the same temperature than water molecules.\n\nOverall, the behaviors are similar, but the temperature and pressure conditions for each substance to transition between states differ.","q13":"My predictions were mostly correct. I predicted that in the solid state, molecules would be tightly packed and only vibrate, which was accurate for both water and carbon dioxide. In the liquid state, I expected the molecules to move more freely, which was true for both substances as well. However, my prediction for the gas state was a bit off; I had expected the molecules to move more similarly, but I noticed that carbon dioxide molecules move slower than water molecules at the same temperature, which was an interesting difference. Overall, my predictions were correct with some minor differences in the details of molecular behavior between water and carbon dioxide.","q14":"States of matter are different based on the temperature, motion, and spacing of the particles. As temperature increases, the particles gain more energy, which causes them to move faster. In solids, particles are tightly packed and only vibrate in place, while in liquids, particles are still close but can move past one another. In gases, particles are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles have, leading to greater motion and more space between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q15":"When you pump new particles in, the pressure increases. This happens because adding more particles to the same space causes the molecules to collide more frequently with the walls of the container, which increases the pressure. The more particles present, the more force is exerted on the walls.","q16":"The pumped-in particles stick to the substance because of intermolecular forces. These are the attractive forces between molecules, which can include Van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, or hydrogen bonds, depending on the substance. These forces cause the new particles to attach to the existing ones, especially in liquids and solids where the molecules are already close together. This concept was discussed at the end of Chapter 6 when we learned how molecular attractions influence phase changes and behavior of matter.","q17":"As the solid heats up, the particles begin to move faster and vibrate more intensely. The increased motion causes the particles to spread apart slightly, leading to a decrease in the density of the substance. As a result, the pressure may decrease slightly if the volume remains constant. The faster movement and increased energy of the particles help the substance transition from solid to liquid, as seen during melting.","q18":"To increase the pressure, you can either increase the temperature or add more particles. When the temperature rises, the particles gain more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently with the container walls. This increased movement results in higher pressure. Similarly, adding more particles increases the number of collisions, which also raises the pressure. Repeating these actions—heating the substance or adding more particles—will continue to raise the pressure by increasing the frequency and force of molecular collisions.","q19":"If you continue to heat the substance, the pressure will keep increasing. As the temperature rises, the particles move faster, causing more frequent and forceful collisions with the container walls. This results in an increase in pressure. If the substance is in a confined space and cannot expand, the pressure will continue to build as the temperature rises, following the relationship described by Gay-Lussac's Law.","q20":"When you push down on the container, the pressure increases. This happens because you're reducing the volume available for the particles to move around in. As the space gets smaller, the particles are forced closer together, leading to more frequent collisions with the container walls. According to Boyle's Law, when the volume decreases, the pressure increases, provided the temperature remains constant. The finger pushing down compresses the gas or liquid, causing the pressure to rise.","q21":"If you heat up the container too much or push down too much, the pressure can increase to the point where the container may break or explode. Excessive heating causes the particles to move extremely fast and create high pressure, while pushing down reduces the volume, which also raises the pressure. If the pressure becomes too great and exceeds the strength of the container, it could rupture, releasing the gas or liquid rapidly. This demonstrates the importance of maintaining balanced temperature and pressure in a closed system.","q22":"If the container explodes, the particles are suddenly released into the surrounding space. The gas or liquid particles will expand rapidly, spreading out in all directions. In a gas, the particles will move freely and quickly, filling the available space, while in a liquid, the particles will also spread out but will not move as freely as gas particles. The expansion happens because the pressure that was previously contained is now released, and the particles will spread out to lower-pressure areas.","q23":"In this experiment, I learned that phase changes and states of matter are closely related to temperature and pressure, and they affect the motion and spacing of particles.\n\nSolid State: In a solid, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place. The temperature is lower, so the particles have less energy, and their movement is limited. Pressure can increase the spacing slightly, but the solid generally retains its shape due to the strong intermolecular forces holding the particles together.\n\nLiquid State: When the substance melts and becomes a liquid, the temperature increases. The particles are still close together but can slide past one another. This increased energy allows them to move more freely. The spacing is more open compared to a solid, and pressure can slightly compress or expand the liquid depending on the environment.\n\nGas State: When the substance is heated further, it turns into a gas. The particles are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. The higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and as the pressure increases, the gas molecules become more compressed. In gases, particles spread out to fill the container, and the motion becomes chaotic and energetic.\n\nOverall, the state of matter depends on the energy of the particles (which is influenced by temperature) and the amount of space available (which is affected by pressure). The particles transition between solid, liquid, and gas as temperature and pressure change, with their spacing and motion adjusting accordingly."}
