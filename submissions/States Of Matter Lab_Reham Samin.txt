They are not moving around freely, but they are slightly vibrating in place. The structure looks stable and rigid, which matches how ice behaves in real life.","q2":"The thermometer is showing the Celsius temperature scale. You can tell because the temperature values are marked in degrees Celsius (°C), which is commonly used in scientific experiments.","q3":"As the temperature increases, the water molecules begin to move faster and spread farther apart. The molecules start to vibrate more intensely and slide past each other, transitioning from a more rigid, organized structure to a less structured, more fluid movement as the solid turns into a liquid.","q4":"The melting/freezing point of water in Kelvin is 273.15 K. This is equivalent to 0°C, which is the temperature at which water changes from solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to solid (freezing).","q5":"Below the melting point, the water molecules are closely packed in a rigid, organized structure, only vibrating slightly in place. Above the melting point, the molecules move faster, spread farther apart, and begin to slide past each other, transitioning into a more fluid, less structured arrangement as the solid turns into a liquid. The spacing increases, and the motion becomes more dynamic above the melting point.","q6":"When water is a liquid, the molecules are close together but not in a fixed arrangement. They move freely and slide past each other, allowing the liquid to flow. The molecules still vibrate but have more freedom to move around compared to a solid, giving the liquid a more dynamic and fluid structure.","q7":"The boiling/condensation point of water in Kelvin is 373.15 K. This is equivalent to 100°C, which is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a gas (boiling) or from a gas to a liquid (condensation).","q8":"Below the boiling point, the water molecules are close together and move freely, sliding past each other in the liquid state. As the temperature approaches the boiling point, the molecules move faster and gain more energy. Above the boiling point, the water molecules are spread further apart and move much more rapidly, transitioning into a gas. The molecules in the gas state move in all directions, bouncing off each other and the container walls, creating a more chaotic motion.","q9":"When water is a gas, the molecules are widely spaced and move very quickly in all directions. They have a lot of energy, bouncing off each other and the walls of the container. The molecules are far apart compared to their arrangement in liquid or solid states, and their motion is much more chaotic and fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q10":"I selected carbon dioxide (CO₂) to investigate.","q11":"Solid: In the solid state, the carbon dioxide molecules are tightly packed in a rigid structure. They vibrate slightly in place but do not move freely.\n\nLiquid: In the liquid state, the molecules are still close together, but they move past one another more freely. The motion is faster compared to the solid state, but the molecules are still more organized than in the gas state.\n\nGas: In the gas state, the molecules are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. They bounce off each other and the walls of the container, creating a very chaotic and energetic motion. The spacing between the molecules is much greater than in the solid or liquid states.","q12":"The motion and spacing of the carbon dioxide molecules are similar to water in each state in that both substances follow the same general principles of behavior:\n\nSolid: Both water and carbon dioxide have molecules that are tightly packed in a fixed structure and vibrate in place. However, carbon dioxide’s solid state appears less organized compared to water's, and it forms a more irregular pattern.\n\nLiquid: In both water and carbon dioxide as liquids, the molecules are close together but move past each other more freely. The motion in both is more fluid, though carbon dioxide in liquid form exists only under high pressure or low temperature, while water can remain liquid under more typical conditions.\n\nGas: In the gas state, both substances have molecules that are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. The key difference is that carbon dioxide gas has molecules that are less energetic compared to water vapor, meaning carbon dioxide molecules move more slowly at the same temperature than water molecules.\n\nOverall, the behaviors are similar, but the temperature and pressure conditions for each substance to transition between states differ.","q13":"My predictions were mostly correct. I predicted that in the solid state, molecules would be tightly packed and only vibrate, which was accurate for both water and carbon dioxide. In the liquid state, I expected the molecules to move more freely, which was true for both substances as well. However, my prediction for the gas state was a bit off; I had expected the molecules to move more similarly, but I noticed that carbon dioxide molecules move slower than water molecules at the same temperature, which was an interesting difference. Overall, my predictions were correct with some minor differences in the details of molecular behavior between water and carbon dioxide.","q14":"States of matter are different based on the temperature, motion, and spacing of the particles. As temperature increases, the particles gain more energy, which causes them to move faster. In solids, particles are tightly packed and only vibrate in place, while in liquids, particles are still close but can move past one another. In gases, particles are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles have, leading to greater motion and more space between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q15":"When you pump new particles in, the pressure increases. This happens because adding more particles to the same space causes the molecules to collide more frequently with the walls of the container, which increases the pressure. The more particles present, the more force is exerted on the walls.","q16":"The pumped-in particles stick to the substance because of intermolecular forces. These are the attractive forces between molecules, which can include Van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, or hydrogen bonds, depending on the substance. These forces cause the new particles to attach to the existing ones, especially in liquids and solids where the molecules are already close together. This concept was discussed at the end of Chapter 6 when we learned how molecular attractions influence phase changes and behavior of matter.","q17":"As the solid heats up, the particles begin to move faster and vibrate more intensely. The increased motion causes the particles to spread apart slightly, leading to a decrease in the density of the substance. As a result, the pressure may decrease slightly if the volume remains constant. The faster movement and increased energy of the particles help the substance transition from solid to liquid, as seen during melting.","q18":"To increase the pressure, you can either increase the temperature or add more particles. When the temperature rises, the particles gain more kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently with the container walls. This increased movement results in higher pressure. Similarly, adding more particles increases the number of collisions, which also raises the pressure. Repeating these actions—heating the substance or adding more particles—will continue to raise the pressure by increasing the frequency and force of molecular collisions.","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":""}
