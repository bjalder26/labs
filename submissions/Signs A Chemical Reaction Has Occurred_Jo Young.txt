{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Jo Young","observations1":"Bubbles created, released cloud, cloud put out wooden stick flame (cloud was made of Carbon dioxide), due to our stick being dropped into the tube, impossible/difficult to determine whether experiment was ectothermic or endothermic. ","observations2":"created bubbles, created Oxygen, this is known because the flame grew from the Oxygen release, color changed from clear ish to orange. ","observations3":"Created bubbles, also created hydrogen gas as well as heat. ","observations4":"gave off a bad scent, caused the litmus paper to change from red to blue when interacting with the produced ammonia. ","observations6":"color change from silver to black/dark. solid formation occurred at the bottom of the test tube. ","observationsEthanol":"Carbon Dioxide produced as well as water vapor. ","observationsMagnesium":"Sparks were seen as well as a very bright light. powdery residue. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"1. The flame of the stick was put out signifying the formation of Carbon Dioxide.  \n2. The stick flame grew immensely when interacting with the gas formed, Oxygen. \n3. The popping noise that resulted from the quick release of hydrogen. \n4. The ammonia released caused the litmus test to change colors. \n"}
