{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Dylan Webb","q1":"They are avoiding the nucleus.","q2":"They swerve away from the nucleus strongly.","q3":"They are bouncing off of each other's nucleus and into each other's, because they are avoiding the nucleus so strongly.","q4":"There are more protons focused inside of the nucleus.","q5":"It does not seem to change how they travel.","q6":"Because neutrons are neutrally charged.","q7":"They will gently swerve away from the nucleus in a slightly different direction.","q8":"They will move away from it more strongly, turning in a new direction entirely (left or right).","q9":"With 20 protons, the nucleus isn't as charged so they don't move as strongly away, but with 100 protons it is very charged, they will completely swerve to avoid it/bounce off of it strongly.","q10":"They go straight through.","q11":"They were avoiding the nucleus, causing them to go in various directions with varying kinds of strength.","q12":"I think it changed because we found that there was a dense area in the middle, the nucleus, while the rest was mostly empty.","q13":"Alpha particles are positive and thus deflected by protons.","q14":"An isotope is when the number of protons and neutrons are different, changing the atomic mass number but not the atomic number, and the electrons seem to remain the same as the protons.","q15":"An atom is the smallest unit of any given element and element is made up of the same atoms, but an isotope of an element is when the atom has the same number of protons as an element but different neutrons.","q16":"Determine how many protons there are, the same as the electron number, and use it to find the element. Adding the neutrons to that determines the mass.","q17":"Add the atomic number of the element with the number of neutrons to get the mass of the isotope.","q18":"In my mix you can freely add hydrogen-1 and -2 atoms, and I chose to spread them and put an equal number of both.
