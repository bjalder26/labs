{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Skylar Farris","observations1":"After lighting the splint and putting in the tube the fire went out and the bottom of the tube heated up a bit. ","observations2":"When mixing the two chemicals the color turned yellow and it had a slight bubble. After putting the glowing splint in the tube, it got hot, and the mixture bubbles. ","observations3":"When putting the flame in the tube it popped. The mixture in the tube started to bubble and the tube heated up. ","observations4":"After putting the paper in the tube it turned blue and you could smell the ammonia.  ","observations6":"The color of the liquid copper changed from blue to clear and the zinc absorbed the color of the copper and changed its color from silver-ish to an almost black. ","observationsEthanol":"After lighting the ethanol, there was a small flame. While holding the test tube with the ice inside up against the flame, the ice started melting a little and the tube got foggy. ","observationsMagnesium":"While lighting the piece of magnesium with the flame of the bunsen burner there was a quick bright light that appeared with the magnesium. When the light went away the piece of magnesium turned white. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"For test tube one, The reason I could conclude is that the wood splint's fire went out as soon as we put the flame in the test tube making the gas carbon dioxide. For test tube two, the reason I could conclude is that the wood splint burned brighter when being put in the test tube. For test tube three, the reason I could conclude is that the wood splint made a pop noise and the fire sparked up a bit. For test tube four, the paper turned blue and the smell of the gas was strong giving off ammonia. \n"}
