{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Kaitlyn Edlin","observations1":"flame went out ","observations2":"liquid turned yellow, flame didn't go out, bubbles occurred, and the test tube got hotter","observations3":"ribbon turned white, bubbles occurred, temperature became warm, it combusted (popped)","observations4":"the paper turned blue, scent smelt like bleach ","observations6":"liquid is turning clear and solid is now black","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"Test tube 1 was easy to identify since the gas extinguished the flame. Test tube 2, the gas produced kept the flame going. Test tube 3 when the gas came in contact with the flame it combusted showing that the gas produced was hydrogen. The gas produced in test tube 4 turned the litmus paper blue indicating ammonia was present. "}
