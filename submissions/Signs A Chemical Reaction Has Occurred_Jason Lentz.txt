{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Jason Lentz","observations1":"As the reaction was ongoing it produced bubbles and the resulting gas therefor extinguished the fire.","observations2":"The temperature changed during the reaction as well as the color, which it turned to yellow. The fire was then re lit. ","observations3":"The gas mixed with the fire, produced a tiny combustion and a popping noise.","observations4":"The fire burned up the ammonium and the resulting gas produced a bad smell. The red litmus paper turned from red to more of a violet color.","observations6":"Copper in the solution combined with the zinc, therefore the liquid became clearer and the zinc turned black.","observationsEthanol":"Fire melted the ice and then the water began to release vapor on that stuck to the sides of the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"After catching fire the magnesium burned brightly and quickly faded. Leaving behind a brittle ashen piece of burnt magnesium.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
