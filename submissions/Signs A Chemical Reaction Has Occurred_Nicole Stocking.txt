Yes relite. Color turned yellow. It became hot.","observations3":"Bubbles were not as frequent, and pressure did build although weak. Although reacted very actively with the flame. Flame immediately extinguished with a pop sound. No color change. Tube became hot.","observations4":"No bubbles. The litmus paper changed color from pink to purple. Test tube was very hot. Pungent, burning odor came from the tube. ","observations6":"The zinc darkened while the Copper II Chloride became lighter in color.","observationsEthanol":"No temperature change. No light. No flame.
