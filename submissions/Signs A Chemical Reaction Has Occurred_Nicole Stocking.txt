{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Nicole Stocking","observations1":"The reaction fizzed to the point of overflowing. The flame extinguished by the gas. The color remained the same, no color change. The tube remained the same temperature. ","observations2":"The reaction caused it to fizz. The flame relite once it touched the gas. The color changed from white to a mustered yellow. The tube became hot from the reaction.","observations3":"Bubbles were not as frequent, and pressure did build but weak. The flame reacted with the gas, causing it to extinguish immediately with a pop sound. The color of the reaction remained constant. The tube became hot to the touch.","observations4":"The reaction did not cause any bubbles or fizzing. Once it touch the gas, the litmus paper changed color from pink to purple immediately. The test tube was very hot but mostly because it was held over the burner. Once lite, a pungent, burning odor came from the tube. ","observations6":"The zinc remained solid but slowly changed color. The zinc darkened while the Copper II Chloride became lighter in color.","observationsEthanol":"The temperature in the tube remained constant. There was no light or flame that came out of the reaction. The reaction left condesation on ","observationsMagnesium":"Ribbon caught on fire. Burned so bright we had to look away. Flame ignited bright then immediately went out. Color changed from silver to white. Ash.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":"We were able to deduce the identity of each gas "}
