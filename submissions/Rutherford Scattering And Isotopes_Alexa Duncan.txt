{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Alexa Duncan","q1":"Purple particles start flying across the screen. ","q2":"I donâ€™t see a change in the way they move. ","q3":"The particles start to move in different directions. They bounce off the middle of the orbital. ","q4":"The more particles there are the less space there is to share. So they changed direction to allow more space. ","q5":"They seem to do the same thing as before with the other ones ","q6":"Maybe because electrons are just negative charges. ","q7":"They bounce off the nucleus.","q8":"if the alpha particles are positively charged will deflect away from the nucleus.","q9":"Because the number of protons determines the element in itself. ","q10":"upward.","q11":"the atoms look completely different. ","q12":"To advance science.","q13":"They are both positive.","q14":"An isotope is an element with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons. ","q15":"an element is a material on the periodic table. an atom is a small particle that makes up your body. and isotope is a difference in neutrons for the same element. ","q16":"First look for the number of protons or atomic number. you add the neutrons and protons to get a mass number. ","q17":"you would combine the atomic number and neutrons.","q18":"my mix is a personalized mix of hydrogen 1 and hydrogen 2 particles. Natures mix are real ones that are already made.
