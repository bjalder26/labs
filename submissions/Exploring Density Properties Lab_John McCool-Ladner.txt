The percent error for my water density was low. \n2.) the density I calculated for sea water was higher than the density of water.\n3.) I think I correctly identified the unknown solid, and it was aluminum.\n4.) I think I correctly identified the unknown solid, and it was methanol.\n5.) No, my copper percent was far from 2.5 percent at 20 percent."}
