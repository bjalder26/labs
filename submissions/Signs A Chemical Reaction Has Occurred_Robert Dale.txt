{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Robert Dale","observations1":"When the fire was put in bubbled, and fog was formed in the container, putting the fire out due to the carbon dioxide. However, part of the stick was dropped into the container meaning we cannot tell if it was endo thermic or not.","observations2":"When the fire was added the mixture bubbled, turned orange and kept the flame burning. The temperature increased as the flame grew due to the oxygen created from the mixture.","observations3":"When fire was added the mixture heated, bubbled and then a release of gas occurred due to the release of hydrogen causing a pop sound. ","observations4":"The ammonium carbonate heated then created ammonia gas. When the litmus paper was added the paper went from a red color to a blue color showing the alkalinity of the gas ammonia which was created.","observations6":"The zinc went to the bottom of the copper chloride and turned black. The liquid was unchanged.","observationsEthanol":"Visible flame combined with the release of heat. Resulted in production of co2.","observationsMagnesium":"The magnesium increases temperature and turns into magnesium oxide. The burning caused bright sparks. The magnesium then went from a solid into a powdery substance. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"Test tube 1- carbon dioxide released from the mixture put out the flame.\nTest tube 2- The flame brightened and intensified showing the presence of oxygen from the mixture.\nTest tube 3- The gas reacted explosively with the flame causing a release of gas and a pop sound.\nTest tube 4- The gas when reacting with the flame and the litmus paper caused the litmus to turn blue. Showing the presence of Ammonia gas and its alkalinity."}
