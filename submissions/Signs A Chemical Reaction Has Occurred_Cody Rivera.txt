{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Cody Rivera","observations1":"There were a lot of bubbles at first, then I felt the pressure build-up when I covered the test tube with my thumb. Then the fire was put out by the carbon dioxide that was produced. ","observations2":"There were bubbles when they first were in contact with each other. Then it turned yellow. There was also pressure build-up. Also, it did get a tad bit hot. ","observations3":"After adding the magnesium to HCL, it started to fizz, got hot, and made big bubbles. Then we put the flame into it, making a loud combusting noise, and put the flame out. ","observations4":"The powder turned into a gas and gave off a nasty-smelling odor. Then turned the red paper into a blue one after it came into contact with the ammonia. ","observations6":"The Zinc became a liquid after shaking. Then the color changed from blue to black.","observationsEthanol":"Yes, it got hotter, there was a flame that started, and also a smell once the liquid was poured into the evaporation dish. ","observationsMagnesium":"Yes, it heated up and caught on fire. After being lit on fire, it became a white product and became very brittle but kept its shape. While burning, it produced smoke as well. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"Test tube one was carbon diocxide because it put the fire out once it came into contact with it.
