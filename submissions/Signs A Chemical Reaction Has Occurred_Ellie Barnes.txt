{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Ellie Barnes","observations1":"Chemical bubbled and had a slight temperature change, when wooden splint was placed into test tube and the flame was put out almost immediatly.","observations2":"The chemical started to bubbled and there was a temperature change, and slightly relighted the ember.","observations3":"Chemical bubbled and temperature changed, the flame went out and there was a popping sound.","observations4":"The paper turned blue, and gave off a smell of ammonia","observations6":"The zinc became a darker color, while the Copper Chloride became a lighter color when mixed together.","observationsEthanol":"the tube became foggy with a temperature change.","observationsMagnesium":"There was a bright light and smoke from the magnesium ribbon.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"By looking at table two and what we observed during the reaction, we were able to indicate which gas was produced in each reaction. Each experiment used different chemicals and solids to create each gas, therefor allowing us to identify the gases."}
