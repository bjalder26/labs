{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Marquavius Bates","q1":" The majority of alpha particles will pass through the gold foil with little deflection, suggesting that most of the atom is empty space, and the positive charge is concentrated in a small nucleus.","q2":"With more protons, the alpha particles will experience greater deflection due to the stronger positive charge of the nucleus. This means the nucleus is more influential in altering the path of the alpha particles.","q3":"The deflection of alpha particles increases further, showing that the nucleus becomes even stronger with more protons. This is consistent with the idea that the nucleus' positive charge grows as protons increase.\n\n","q4":"The change happens because the strength of the electromagnetic force between the positively charged alpha particles and the positively charged nucleus increases as the number of protons (and thus the positive charge) increases.","q5":"","q6":"","q7":"","q8":"","q9":"","q10":"In the Plum-Pudding model, the alpha particles are expected to pass through with only slight deflections, as the positive charge is thought to be distributed throughout the atom.","q11":"In the Rutherford model, most alpha particles were deflected by a dense, positively charged nucleus. In the Plum-Pudding model, the alpha particles wouldn't be deflected as much since the positive charge is spread throughout the atom, not concentrated in the nucleus.","q12":"Rutherford’s experiment showed that the atom has a dense, positively charged nucleus, which contradicted the Plum-Pudding model where the positive charge was thought to be spread out.","q13":"The deflection happens because alpha particles are positively charged, and they experience a repulsive force when they come near the nucleus, which also carries a positive charge.","q14":"Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, leading to different mass numbers.","q15":"Element: A substance made of atoms of the same type, defined by the number of protons.\nAtom: The smallest unit of an element, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons.\nIsotope: A variant of an element, where the atoms have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.","q16":"The mass of an isotope is the sum of the protons and neutrons.\nThe name is determined by the element's name followed by its mass number (e.g., Carbon-14).","q17":"Add the number of protons (which defines the element) to the number of neutrons to get the mass number of the isotope.","q18":"My Mix allows you to create a specific mixture of isotopes, while Nature’s Mix shows you the natural abundance of isotopes for various elements.","q19":"The chance of finding an isotope of an element varies by element. Some isotopes are more abundant in nature than others, which is why the atomic mass of elements is often a weighted average","avgsi":"2","q21":" You could check this by looking up the natural abundances of the isotopes of Silicon, which are not equal. The actual natural abundance should be used to calculate the weighted average.","avgfemass":"0","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
