{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Marquavius Bates","q1":" The majority of alpha particles will pass through the gold foil with little deflection, suggesting that most of the atom is empty space, and the positive charge is concentrated in a small nucleus.","q2":"With more protons, the alpha particles will experience greater deflection due to the stronger positive charge of the nucleus. This means the nucleus is more influential in altering the path of the alpha particles.","q3":"The deflection of alpha particles increases further, showing that the nucleus becomes even stronger with more protons. This is consistent with the idea that the nucleus' positive charge grows as protons increase.\n\n","q4":"The change happens because the strength of the electromagnetic force between the positively charged alpha particles and the positively charged nucleus increases as the number of protons (and thus the positive charge) increases.","q5":"No, varying the number of neutrons does not change how the alpha particles travel through the gold foil. Neutrons are neutral particles and do not affect the electromagnetic interaction between the alpha particles (which are positively charged) and the positively charged protons in the nucleus.","q6":"The number of neutrons does not influence the path of the alpha particles because neutrons carry no charge. The alpha particles interact primarily with the positively charged protons in the nucleus, which causes the deflection. Since neutrons don't carry a charge, they don't contribute to the electromagnetic force that affects the movement of the alpha particles.","q7":" With 20 protons, most of the alpha particles pass through the gold foil with minimal deflection. A few particles experience slight deflections, which suggests that the positive charge is concentrated in a small region at the center of the atom (the nucleus), and most of the atom is empty space. The interactions between the alpha particles and the nucleus are relatively weak because the nucleus has a moderate charge.\n\n","q8":"With 60 protons, the alpha particles experience greater deflection as they pass through the gold foil. The stronger positive charge of the nucleus exerts a greater force on the alpha particles, causing more noticeable deviations in their paths. This shows that the nucleus has a much stronger influence on the alpha particles due to the increased number of protons and the stronger electromagnetic force.","q9":"When the number of protons is increased to 100, the deflection of the alpha particles becomes even more pronounced compared to when there are only 20 protons. With 100 protons, the nucleus has an even stronger positive charge, which exerts a more substantial force on the alpha particles, leading to greater deflections. This shows how the strength of the nuclear force increases with the number of protons, making the nucleus more influential in altering the paths of the alpha particles. The greater the number of protons, the stronger the electromagnetic repulsion between the positively charged alpha particles and the nucleus, resulting in more significant deflections.","q10":"In the Plum-Pudding model, the alpha particles are expected to pass through with only slight deflections, as the positive charge is thought to be distributed throughout the atom.","q11":"In the Rutherford model, most alpha particles were deflected by a dense, positively charged nucleus. In the Plum-Pudding model, the alpha particles wouldn't be deflected as much since the positive charge is spread throughout the atom, not concentrated in the nucleus.","q12":"Rutherford’s experiment showed that the atom has a dense, positively charged nucleus, which contradicted the Plum-Pudding model where the positive charge was thought to be spread out.","q13":"The deflection happens because alpha particles are positively charged, and they experience a repulsive force when they come near the nucleus, which also carries a positive charge.","q14":"Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, leading to different mass numbers.","q15":"Element: A substance made of atoms of the same type, defined by the number of protons.\nAtom: The smallest unit of an element, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons.\nIsotope: A variant of an element, where the atoms have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.","q16":"The mass of an isotope is the sum of the protons and neutrons.\nThe name is determined by the element's name followed by its mass number (e.g., Carbon-14).","q17":"Add the number of protons (which defines the element) to the number of neutrons to get the mass number of the isotope.","q18":"My Mix allows you to create a specific mixture of isotopes, while Nature’s Mix shows you the natural abundance of isotopes for various elements.","q19":"The chance of finding an isotope of an element varies by element. Some isotopes are more abundant in nature than others, which is why the atomic mass of elements is often a weighted average","avgsi":"29","q21":" You could check this by looking up the natural abundances of the isotopes of Silicon, which are not equal. The actual natural abundance should be used to calculate the weighted average.","avgfemass":"55.85","q22":"The slight difference is due to rounding when calculating the weighted average, as the periodic table value is more precise. However, the results are essentially the same, confirming that the calculation method is accurate and aligns with known values for iron.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
