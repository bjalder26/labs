{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Marquavius Bates","q1":"Most of the alpha particles would pass through the gold foil and suffer little deflection, indicating that much of the atom is empty space, with the positive charge concentrated at the centre in a very tiny volume called the nucleus.","q2":"With more protons, the alpha particles will be deflected more strongly by the nucleus due to its greater positive charge. That means the nucleus is now more powerful in changing the course of the alpha particles.","q3":"The deflection of alpha particles increases further, showing that the nucleus becomes even stronger with more protons. This is in line with expectations that the positive charge of the nucleus increases as protons increase.\n","q4":"The change happens because the strength of the electromagnetic force between the positively charged alpha particles and the positively charged nucleus increases as the number of protons (and thus the positive charge) increases.","q5":"No, varying the number of neutrons does not change how the alpha particles travel through the gold foil. Neutrons are neutral particles and do not affect the electromagnetic interaction between the alpha particles (which are positively charged) and the positively charged protons in the nucleus.","q6":"The number of neutrons does not influence the path of the alpha particles because neutrons carry no charge. The alpha particles interact primarily with the positively charged protons in the nucleus, which causes the deflection. Since neutrons don't carry a charge, they don't contribute to the electromagnetic force that affects the movement of the alpha particles.","q7":"It contains 20 protons. Most of the alpha particles hardly experience any deviation as they pass through the gold foil. A few particles, however, had slight deviations, which indeed explained that the positive charge was concentrated in a very small region at the center of the atom, called the nucleus, and most the volume of the atom was empty space. The scattering of alpha particles by the nucleus is relatively weak since it carries a moderate charge.\n\n","q8":"With 60 protons, the alpha particles experience greater deflection as they pass through the gold foil. The stronger positive charge of the nucleus exerts a greater force on the alpha particles, causing more noticeable deviations in their paths. This shows that the nucleus has a much stronger influence on the alpha particles due to the increased number of protons and the stronger electromagnetic force.","q9":"With 100 protons, the deflection of the alpha particles is much greater compared to that when there were only 20 protons. The increase to 100 protons means the nucleus now has a much greater positive charge, and so greater force on the alpha particles means greater deflections. This demonstrates how the strength of the nuclear force increases with the number of protons, making the nucleus more influential in altering the paths of the alpha particles. The more protons in a nucleus, the stronger the electromagnetic repulsion for positively charged alpha particles, and the bigger the deflection.","q10":"In the Plum-Pudding model, the alpha particles are expected to pass through with only slight deflections, as the positive charge is thought to be distributed throughout the atom.","q11":"In the Rutherford model, most alpha particles were deflected by a dense, positively charged nucleus. In the Plum-Pudding model, the alpha particles wouldn't be deflected as much since the positive charge is spread throughout the atom, not concentrated in the nucleus.","q12":"Rutherford’s experiment showed that the atom has a dense, positively charged nucleus, which contradicted the Plum-Pudding model where the positive charge was thought to be spread out.","q13":"The deflection happens because alpha particles are positively charged, and they experience a repulsive force when they come near the nucleus, which also carries a positive charge.","q14":"Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, leading to different mass numbers.","q15":"Element: A substance made of atoms of the same type, defined by the number of protons.\nAtom: The smallest unit of an element, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons.\nIsotope: A variant of an element, where the atoms have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.","q16":"The mass of an isotope is the sum of the protons and neutrons.\nThe name is determined by the element's name followed by its mass number (e.g., Carbon-14).","q17":"Add the number of protons (which defines the element) to the number of neutrons to get the mass number of the isotope.","q18":"My Mix allows you to create a specific mixture of isotopes, while Nature’s Mix shows you the natural abundance of isotopes for various elements.","q19":"The chance of finding an isotope of an element varies by element. Some isotopes are more abundant in nature than others, which is why the atomic mass of elements is often a weighted average","avgsi":"29","q21":" You could check this by looking up the natural abundances of the isotopes of Silicon, which are not equal. The actual natural abundance should be used to calculate the weighted average.","avgfemass":"55.85","q22":"The slight difference is due to rounding when calculating the weighted average, as the periodic table value is more precise. However, the results are essentially the same, confirming that the calculation method is accurate and aligns with known values for iron.","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":"nitrogen-14 and nitrogen-15 are both likely to be found in dirt. Their presence in soil reflects natural processes in the nitrogen cycle, and the isotopic composition is representative of the nitrogen found in plants, organic matter, and the atmosphere."}
