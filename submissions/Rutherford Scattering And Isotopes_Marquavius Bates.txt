Also, whenever they get close to the atom, they bounce off and turn in different directions.","q2":"yes, they are going at a curve instead of straight in the middle. They go straight for a second then start at an angle to the left or right.","q3":"a lot of the protons are going in different directions. Hitting the nucleus more and bouncing off of them.","q4":"I think that since the protons are changing it will lead to a stronger repulsive force.","q5":"No","q6":"No, because the number of neutrons does not directly affect the movement of the particles going through the foil.","q7":"They are mostly moving straight until some particles get near the nucleus and then they do diverge away from the nucleus. ","q8":"The particles are now going at a curve going away from the nucleus. ","q9":"at 20 protons the particles were going straight going past the nucleus. But now at 100 protons, the particles are diverging before passing the nucleus and going in diffrent directions. ","q10":"They are going straight passing through the model","q11":"it's different because none of the particles are bouncing off of something and they are completely going straight. ","q12":"rutherford observed more of the particles passing through and bouncing off the postivily charged atoms","q13":"becuase the alpha particles in the rutherford model are positively charged and the nucleus are also po","q14":"","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"28.9747","q21":"","avgfemass":"55.8747","q22":"","isotope1":"carbon-14","isotope2":"one and two","isotope3":"1.5 amu","isotope4":"37.5 amu","q28":""}
