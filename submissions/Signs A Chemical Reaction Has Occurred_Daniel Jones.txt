","observations3":"Carbon Dioxide resulted in extinguishing the flame on the splinter ","observations4":"Ammonia resulted in a color change on litmus paper. The color changed from blue to purple","observations6":"No color change. The zinc is being separated from the copper.","observationsEthanol":"The lime water changed color because of the CO2 released from the ignited candle. Condensation then occurred. ","observationsMagnesium":"With use of heat and flames, magnesium's color was changed and further oxidized.
