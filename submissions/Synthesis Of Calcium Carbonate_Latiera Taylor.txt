As the mixture is heated the liquid becomes less thick, and as the mixture sit to cool a clear and white liquid separates from each other. The clear being on top.","massFilter":"50.170","massFilter&CaCO3":"50.622","massCaCO3":"0.452","volCaCl2-2":"100","theoreticalMassCaCO3":"1","theoreticalYieldCaCO3":"45.2","conclusion":"No, my percent yield is not close to 100 percent, due to an accident after taking the watch glass out of the oven and the filter paper sliding off the glass onto the floor and that caused us to scoop as much as possible off the floor but not all of it. Another reason can be because some of the solid is in the trash that was left on the floor."}
