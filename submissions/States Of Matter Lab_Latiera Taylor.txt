","p2":"In the liquid state, molecules will look less orderly but tightly together gravitating downward.","p3":"In the gas state, molecules will look spaced out and will take up as much space as possible.","q1":"The solid is spaced very closely together and moving minimally. While the liquid is moving more freely, but still together towards the bottom of the container. ","q2":"Kelvin","q3":"They spread outwards and move more freely than before. ","q4":"273 K.","q5":"The molecules become more loose and able to move more freely when above melting point as to being confined to limited space below melting point.","q6":"While gravitating closely together downward, still moving more freely than when solid.","q7":"373 K.","q8":"When below melting point, the molecules are tightly together. But when above melting point, the molecules move faster and space out.","q9":"They are spaced out and moving around slower but able to move further away from other molecules.","q10":"Liquid","q11":"The molecules are moving closer to each other and downward as you remove heat, and they move away from each other and circle around container instead of staying in one spot as you add heat.","q12":"Water gravitates downward just like the liquid molecules does. Also, water stores together like the liquid molecules. Water is different because all liquids are not water but water is a liquid.
