{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Addison Smith","observations1":"After mixing the solution, it bubbled over. Then, when we added the splint, the flame went out. The tube was cold to the touch.","observations2":"Once we lit the splint and put it in the tube the hydrogen peroxide bubbled, and the stick sparked again. The tube then became hot.","observations3":"Whenever we dropped the ribbon in the tube, it started to bubble and heat up. Then we put the ignited splint in the tube and it made a popping sound and extinguished, causing the tube to heat up more.","observations4":"The litmus paper turned blue after being exposed to the Ammonium Carbonate gas. The test tube became very hot and gave off a pungent odor. ","observations6":"Whenever we added the zinc to the copper chloride the zinc turned black and clumped together at the bottom, then later the solution became colorless.","observationsEthanol":"We lit the Ethyl Alcohol on fire then held the test tube over it. The ice in the tube melted and the glass became warmer.","observationsMagnesium":"We lit the Bunsen burner and then held the ribbon over it, causing it to ignite and burn and glow. There was a burn residue left over on the watch glass.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were able to deduce each gas based on the reaction it caused when introduced to a burning splint. In test tube one, the flame extinguished, indicating that carbon dioxide was present. In test tube two, the flame began to burn brighter, meaning that there was oxygen present to fuel the fire. In the third test tube, whenever we put the lit splint near the tube it made a popping sound. And lastly, in test tube four whenever we heated the tube there was a pungent recognizable odor being emitted from the solution. "}
