{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Cole Campbell","observations1":"There was a flame but it is extinguished after introducing the CO2 gas, so the temperature drops significantly ","observations2":"When oxygen gas is formed in the test tube, air bubbles emerge from it. The glowing splint then ignites the test tube in the presence of the oxygen, causing the bottom of the tube to become heated.","observations3":"The test tube starts crackling as the hydrogen gas is emitted, it becomes an exothermic reaction and you can feel the heat after the test tube ignites after a short period of time.","observations4":"As a result of the ammonium carbonate, the red litmus paper will switch to blue, no bubbles. The ammonia will create a strong, distinct scent as the test tube heats. ","observations6":"The blueish-green begins to turn into a pale color as the zinc chloride takes over. Then the copper forms into solid rust as the zinc dissolves.","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
