{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Elisabeth Tarpley","observations1":"When the vinegar first gets mixed with the sodium bicarbonate it creates bubbles and releases a gas. When the wood splint was put into the tube the fire it immediately went out. Because of this I would guess it releases a carbon dioxide gas.","observations2":"When the hydrogen peroxide mixes with the potassium iodide it creates a yellow liquid and bubbles and creates a gas. When the fire was put into the gas it burned brighter and it would relight. Because of this reaction I would assume the gas is oxygen.
