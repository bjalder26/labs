{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Elisabeth Tarpley","observations1":"When the vinegar first gets mixed with the sodium bicarbonate it creates bubbles and releases a gas. When the wood splint was put into the tube the fire it immediately went out. Because of this I would guess it releases a carbon dioxide gas.","observations2":"When the hydrogen peroxide mixes with the potassium iodide it creates a yellow liquid and bubbles and creates a gas. When the fire was put into the gas it burned brighter and it would relight. Because of this reaction I would assume the gas is oxygen. ","observations3":"When the hydrochloric acid mixes with the magnesium ribbon it bubbled and created a gas. When the splint was put into the tube it made a loud pop noise and the test tube got warm.","observations4":"When the ammonium carbonate was heated it created a gas with a bas that turned the litmus paper blue. When you waft the gas it has a very strong smell.","observations6":"When the copper chloride and solid zinc were combined it first created bubbles and when they were mixed it had solid black sediment at the bottom of the test tube and the liquid turned a grey murky color.","observationsEthanol":"The ice in test tube created condensation when exposed to the fire emitted from the ethyl alcohol. The test tube was cold to the touch after being exposed to the fire.","observationsMagnesium":"When the magnesium ribbon was exposed to the bunsen burner flame it emitted a bright white light.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"We were able to deduce the gases in test tubes 1-4 by observing the reaction the fire from the wood splint reacted with the gas emitted from each test tube."}
