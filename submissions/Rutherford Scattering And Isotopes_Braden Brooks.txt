{"labName":"Rutherford Scattering And Isotopes","userName":"Braden Brooks","q1":"The alpha particles avoid the nucleus and keep going up. They get close to the nucleus and bounce off of it.","q2":"The particles get stopped at the nucleus and get redirected away. ","q3":"The alpha particles get pushed around a lot when they get near the nucleus and they move faster in random directions.","q4":"The protons are a pushing force to the alpha particles.","q5":"Yes","q6":"With less neutrons than protons the alpha particles get pushed faster in other directions but the radius of the pushing is smaller. With more neutrons the radius of the Adom increases effecting more alpha particles. ","q7":"they get pushed away.","q8":"They get pushed further away.  ","q9":"With 20 protons the particles can still go up, they just get pushed a little. With 100 protons the particles get completely sent backwards and get pushed farther. ","q10":"They go up and are uninterrupted. ","q11":"They are able to go through without being pushed like in the Rutherford simulation. ","q12":"The particles get affected by the atom in ways they suggest that the atom is a circle type shape.","q13":"The nucleus was giving off energy that physically pushed the particles.","q14":"A isotope is a variant ","q15":"","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","avgsi":"","q21":"","avgfemass":"","q22":"","isotope1":"","isotope2":"","isotope3":"","isotope4":"","q28":""}
