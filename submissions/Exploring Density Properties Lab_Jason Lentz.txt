Water's at 20 degrees Celsius was .998 our seawater was ..997. \n3.Yes our calculated density was 9.1 and the closest to it was copper which was 8.94.\n4.Yes our calculated was .781 and the closest to it was Methanol which was .791.\n5.Ours was 7.3% copper, which is above the 2.5% that is normally in pennies.
