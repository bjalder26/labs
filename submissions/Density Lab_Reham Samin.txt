It looks like they change together, keeping the density the same.","q2":"As the mass increases, the block gets bigger because its volume increases. It still floats in the water since its density stays the same.","q3":"The water level rises a bit as the block gets bigger because more of it is submerged.","q4":"As the volume decreases, the mass also goes down since they change together while keeping the density the same.","q5":"The water level goes down because the block takes up less space in the water.","q6":"No, the block never sinks because it's made of wood, which is less dense than water. It always floats, even when its size changes.","q7":"No, the aluminum block doesn't float. No matter how you adjust the mass or volume, it always sinks because aluminum is denser than water.\n","q8":"As you increase the mass of the aluminum, the volume also increases. They both go up together since the density of aluminum stays constant.","q9":"No, the ice block doesn’t sink. It floats because ice is less dense than water, even when you adjust the mass or volume.","q10":"As you decrease the volume of the ice, the mass also decreases. Since density stays the same, both mass and volume decrease together.","massice":"0.92","volice":"1.00","denIce":".92","q12":"The calculated density for both the previous and the new mass/volume of ice is the same (0.92 kg/L). This shows that the density of ice remains constant regardless of the mass or volume, as long as the material is the same.","q13":"Ice floats in liquid water because its density (0.92 kg/L) is less than that of liquid water (1.00 kg/L). Since objects less dense than the liquid they’re in float, the lower density of ice allows it to stay on top of the water rather than sinking.","q14":"The custom block will float if its density is less than 1.00 kg/L. If the density is greater, it will sink.","q15":"Block B floats, while Block A sinks but takes a minute to hit the ground, and both Block C and Block D sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q16":"When the mass is adjusted to 8.50 kg, Block A now sinks, whereas it didn't before. The increased mass makes it denser, causing it to sink.","q17":"Blocks A, B, and C","q18":"Yes, stacking blocks increases the overall mass, making a block that normally floats sink.","q19":"You can make a block that normally sinks float by stacking it on top of another block. The added displacement from the bottom block can reduce the overall density, helping it float.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q20":"Block B floats and Block D sinks because their densities are different. Even though they have the same mass, Block B has a larger volume, which means it displaces more water and stays afloat. Block D, being smaller, has a higher density and doesn't displace enough water to float.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q21":"Block B and Block D float because their densities are less than water's, while Block A and Block C sink because their densities are greater than water's.","q22":"With the volume decreased to 1.50 L, all the blocks sink because their increased density is now greater than that of water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q23":"With the volume increased to 10.0 L, all the blocks float because their density decreases, making them less dense than water.","q24":"Yes, stacking blocks can make a floating block sink by increasing mass, and make a sinking block float by increasing displacement.","q25":"The blocks float or sink based on their densities. Even though they have the same volume, blocks with lower densities float, while those with higher densities sink.","mass1a":"19.30","vol1a":"5.30","den1a":"3.64","sub1a":"Diamond","mass1b":".40","vol1b":".40","den1b":"1","sub1b":"Water","mass1c":"19.32","vol1c":"1","den1c":"19.32","sub1c":"Gold","mass1d":"5","vol1d":"5","den1d":"1","sub1d":"Titanium","mass1e":"2.80","vol1e":"2.80","den1e":"1","sub1e":"Water","mass2a":"18","vol2a":"1.59","den2a":"11.34","sub2a":"Lead","mass2b":"10.80","vol2b":"4","den2b":"2.7","sub2b":"Glass","mass2c":"2.70","vol2c":"1","den2c":"2.7","sub2c":"Glass","mass2d":"18","vol2d":"4","den2d":"4.5","sub2d":"Titanium","mass2e":"44.80","vol2e":"5","den2e":"8.96","sub2e":"Copper","mass3a":"2.85","vol3a":"2.85","den3a":"1","sub3a":"Water","mass3b":"6","vol3b":"6","den3b":"1","sub3b":"Water","mass3c":"23.40","vol3c":"3","den3c":"7.8","sub3c":"Steel","mass3d":"2","vol3d":"2","den3d":"1","sub3d":"Water","mass3e":"6","vol3e":"6","den3e":"1","sub3e":"Water","q26":"The log floated because it has a large volume and relatively low mass, which results in a low density. Density is the ratio of mass to volume, and for an object to float, its density must be less than that of water. The pebble, on the other hand, has a small volume but a relatively high mass, making its density greater than that of water. Since the pebble’s density is higher than water’s, it doesn't displace enough water to stay afloat, causing it to sink. Therefore, the difference in density between the log and the pebble is why the log floats while the pebble sinks."}
