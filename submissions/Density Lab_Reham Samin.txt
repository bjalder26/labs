{"labName":"Density Lab","userName":"Reham Samin","q1":"As the mass goes up, the volume increases too. It looks like they change together, keeping the density the same.","q2":"As the mass increases, the block gets bigger because its volume increases. It still floats in the water since its density stays the same.","q3":"The water level rises a bit as the block gets bigger because more of it is submerged.","q4":"As the volume decreases, the mass also goes down since they change together while keeping the density the same.","q5":"The water level goes down because the block takes up less space in the water.","q6":"No, the block never sinks because it's made of wood, which is less dense than water. It always floats, even when its size changes.","q7":"No, the aluminum block doesn't float. No matter how you adjust the mass or volume, it always sinks because aluminum is denser than water.\n","q8":"As you increase the mass of the aluminum, the volume also increases. They both go up together since the density of aluminum stays constant.","q9":"No, the ice block doesn’t sink. It floats because ice is less dense than water, even when you adjust the mass or volume.","q10":"As you decrease the volume of the ice, the mass also decreases. Since density stays the same, both mass and volume decrease together.","massice":"0.92","volice":"1.00","denIce":".92","q12":"The calculated density for both the previous and the new mass/volume of ice is the same (0.92 kg/L). This shows that the density of ice remains constant regardless of the mass or volume, as long as the material is the same.","q13":"Ice floats in liquid water because its density (0.92 kg/L) is less than that of liquid water (1.00 kg/L). Since objects less dense than the liquid they’re in float, the lower density of ice allows it to stay on top of the water rather than sinking.","q14":"The custom block will float if its density is less than 1.00 kg/L. If the density is greater, it will sink. You can adjust the mass and volume to change the density.","q15":"Block B floats, while Block A sinks but takes a minute to hit the ground, and both Block C and Block D sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","q16":"","q17":"","q18":"","q19":"","q20":"","q21":"","q22":"","q23":"","q24":"","q25":"","mass1a":"","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
