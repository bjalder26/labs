Liquid is more of a mound, and moves more than the solid. The gas is free floating and not dense.","q12":"Water was a mound as a solid barely moving, as apposed of the cube of oxygen. The liquid form of water is molded to the bottom of the sim, as apposed to the mound of oxygen, both moved similarly. The gas for both were pretty much the same.","q13":"Correct. Solid, is condense and unmoving. Liquid, is dense but moving. Gas is free floating and not dense.","q14":"Solid is different from liquid as their... molds are different, gas is all the way different neither dense or molded, rather free floating.","q15":"The density or mold seems to get disrupted, some stick, some particles fly off as if they were gas.","q16":"This is the same for any substance, if i put water on water, of course its gonna stick together for the most part.","q17":"Become free floating and less dense.","q18":"It get more dense, and the temp goes up.","q19":"It goes up.","q20":"It gets more dense.","q21":"It will explode.","q22":"They become free floating and float away.","q23":"Solid is dense and unmoving, liquid is dense but molded to the bottom, The gas is free floating and not dense. With temp rising on these they eventually all become free floating, the pressure would make these more dense. "}
