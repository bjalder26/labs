{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Lauren Lewis","observations1":"Bubbles formed in the beginning. The Gas from reaction put the fire on the splint out. The test tube got cold.","observations2":"Substance bubbled in the beginning. Wooden splint sparked and popped. Color changed to dark yellow. There was no temperature change. ","observations3":"Substance bubbled, no color change, remained clear. Splint popped and flame went out. The test tube got warm.","observations4":"Ammonium carbonate turned black and the smell changed from no odor, to pungent odor. ","observations6":"We mixed zinc (solid) with copper chloride (liquid) to document changes in solution. The zinc solid turned black and grew in size and copper chloride had no reaction. After some extra time, zinc completely dissolved and turned pink while copper chloride got lighter in color but still t=remained blue. ","observationsEthanol":"Test tube still cold. ice melted, precipitation om outside of test tube. ","observationsMagnesium":"Magnesium turned as bright as the sun and glew. Seemed to have to reach a certain tempurature before combusting. residue was sticky and stuck to beaker tongs.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
