{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Lauren Lewis","observations1":"Bubbles formed in the beginning. The Gas from reaction put the fire on the splint out. test tube got cold.","observations2":"Bubbled in the beginning. Wooden splint sparked and popped. Color changed to dark yellow. no temp change. ","observations3":"Bubbled, no color change remained clear. Splint popped and flame went out. tube got warm.","observations4":"Ammonium carbonate turned black, Smell changed from no odor, to pundgent odor. ","observations6":"We mixed zinc (solid) with copper chloride (liquid) to document changes in solution. The zinc solid turned black and grew in size and copper chloride had no reaction. ","observationsEthanol":"Test tube still cold. ice melted, precipitation om outside of test tube. ","observationsMagnesium":"Magnesium turned as bright as the sun and glew. Seemed to have to reach a certain tempurature before combusting. residue was sticky and stuck to beaker tongs.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
