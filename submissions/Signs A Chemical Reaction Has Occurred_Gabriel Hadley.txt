{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Gabriel Hadley","observations1":"Bubbles, cloudy ","observations2":"Yellow/orange, splint stays lit,, oxygen created","observations3":"Bright light, heat, turned ashy","observations4":"Strip turned blue, ammonia gas formed and caused color change ","observations6":"Formed copper","observationsEthanol":"Carbon dioxide was produced, cloudy solution","observationsMagnesium":"Bright light, flamed was produced after ignition ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":"1. You could tell carbon dioxide was present when the solution became cloudy.\n2. You tell oxygen was being created because of how it was feeding the flame.\n3. You could tell there was hydrogen because of the explosion and lack of flame afterwards.\n4. You could tell ammonia was produced because the strip turned blue. "}
