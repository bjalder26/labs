{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Madison Fisher","observations1":"added heat, fire went out, created bubbles and a white cloud","observations2":"the flame got brighter, the color turned more orange and heat got added ","observations3":"heat was added which made. a pop then had bubbles as the result.\n","observations4":"once heat was added to ammonium carbonate it turned the litmus paper blue, no bubbles were formed.","observations6":"once added and stirred zinc turned black","observationsEthanol":"visible flame combined with release of heat resulted in production of carbon dioxide ","observationsMagnesium":"durning experiment when heat was added it combusted. the magnesium got very bright the turnd into a white powder.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"1. flame on stick went out indicating carbon dioxide was created \n2. stick with flame grew and got bright indicating oxygen was created \n3. the popping indicated the quick release of hydrogen.\n4. the ammonia released causing the litmus paper to turn blue\nthese clues from the experiment is what i used to indicate which gas was being created in each test tube."}
