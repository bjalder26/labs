{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Aleria Griffin","observations1":"In the test tube, bubbles were formed. The fire on the splint went out, which mean it was carbon dioxide. The temperature stayed the same.","observations2":"In test tube 2, bubbles were formed. The color went from clear to yellow. The temperature was the same. The splint kept relighting, which means the gas was oxygen. ","observations3":"In test tube 3, bubbles were formed. The color was the same. The temperature increased. it got hot. It made a popping noise, which mean its hydrogen gas.","observations4":"The litmus test went from red to blue. That was a color change. It scents smelled bad. It smelt like dog pee. It did get hot since it was over the flame.","observations6":"The zinc sunk to the bottom of the test tube. The color of zinc went black. The liquid became a little bit lighter.","observationsEthanol":"","observationsMagnesium":"","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
