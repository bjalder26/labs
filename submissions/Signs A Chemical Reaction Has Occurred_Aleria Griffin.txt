{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Aleria Griffin","observations1":"In the test tube, bubbles were formed. The fire on the splint went out, which mean it was carbon dioxide. The temperature stayed the same.","observations2":"In test tube 2, bubbles were formed. The color went from clear to yellow. The temperature was the same. The splint kept relighting, which means the gas was oxygen. ","observations3":"In test tube 3, bubbles were formed. The color was the same. The temperature increased. it got hot. It made a popping noise, which mean its hydrogen gas.","observations4":"The litmus test went from red to blue. That was a color change. It scents smelled bad. It smelt like dog pee. It did get hot since it was over the flame.","observations6":"The zinc sunk to the bottom of the test tube. The color of zinc went black. The liquid became a little bit lighter.","observationsEthanol":"The ice was cold then hot when over the Ethanol. The test tube turned brown on the outside due to the flame have ethanol. Water was on the outside of the test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"The glass became hot. There was a spark from the magnesium and the flame. It was white ash left. It created a white light which mean energy.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"In conclusion, I was able to identify each gas by the chemical reactions. For example, test tube one was carbon dioxide because the flame went out. Test tube two was oxygen because it kept relighting. Test tube three was hydrogen gas because it made a popping noise. Test tube four was ammonia because it changed colors. "}
