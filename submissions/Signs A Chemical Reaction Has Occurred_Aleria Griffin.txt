{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Aleria Griffin","observations1":"In the test tube, bubbles were formed. The fire on the splint went out, which mean it was carbon dioxide. The temperature stayed the same.","observations2":"In test tube 2, bubbles were formed. The color went from clear to yellow. The temperature was the same. The splint kept relighting, which means the gas was oxygen. ","observations3":"In test tube 3, bubbles were formed. The color was the same. The temperature increased. it got hot. It made a popping noise, which mean its hydrogen gas.","observations4":"The litmus test went from red to blue. That was a color change. It scents smelled bad. It smelt like dog pee. It did get hot since it was over the flame.","observations6":"The zinc sunk to the bottom of the test tube. The color of zinc went black. The liquid became a little bit lighter.","observationsEthanol":"The ice was cold then hot when over the Ethanol. The test tube turned brown on the outside due to the flame have ethanol. ","observationsMagnesium":"The glass became hot. There was a spark from the magnesium and the flame. It was white ash le4ft.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
