{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Katie-Lynn Camp","observations1":"There were a lot of bubbles at first, and then it died down after a second. I felt the mixture had gotten colder. The flame got put out quickly after entering the test tube. ","observations2":"After making the mixture it it had a little bit of bubbles, made a fizzing noise and turned yellow. It got a little warmer, and while the thumb was over it there was pressure. The stick burst into flame after marinating in the fumes for a while.","observations3":"After adding the magnesium strip to the HCL it started fizzing, getting how, and producing big bubbles. Then we put the flame in there and it made a loud clicking noise and put the flame out.","observations4":"After putting it over the fire it almost turned into a liquid type of airiness but still remained a powder consistency. It produced a nasty piercing smell, and it made the red paper turn a purple blue color.","observations6":"The zinc started shedding its outer layer into the copper fluid after shaking it for a while. The color of the liquid and zinc both changed into dark ashy colors.","observationsEthanol":"After lighting the evaporation dish, it went into flames. Then as we held the glass over the fire, the ice melted, and produced a fog on the gas.","observationsMagnesium":"When we put it to the fire, it caught and immediately let out a bright light. After it went out we took a look at it in the dish, ad it had the same shape, just very brittle.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
