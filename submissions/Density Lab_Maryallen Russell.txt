A and C have bigger masses then B and D so they sink","q22":"they all sink","q23":"they all float","q24":"yes if you put the blocks that normally sink on top of the ones that normally float then they will sink.","q25":"because some are heavier then the others","mass1a":"","vol1a":"","den1a":"","sub1a":"","mass1b":"","vol1b":"","den1b":"","sub1b":"","mass1c":"","vol1c":"","den1c":"","sub1c":"","mass1d":"","vol1d":"","den1d":"","sub1d":"","mass1e":"","vol1e":"","den1e":"","sub1e":"","mass2a":"","vol2a":"","den2a":"","sub2a":"","mass2b":"","vol2b":"","den2b":"","sub2b":"","mass2c":"","vol2c":"","den2c":"","sub2c":"","mass2d":"","vol2d":"","den2d":"","sub2d":"","mass2e":"","vol2e":"","den2e":"","sub2e":"","mass3a":"","vol3a":"","den3a":"","sub3a":"","mass3b":"","vol3b":"","den3b":"","sub3b":"","mass3c":"","vol3c":"","den3c":"","sub3c":"","mass3d":"","vol3d":"","den3d":"","sub3d":"","mass3e":"","vol3e":"","den3e":"","sub3e":"","q26":""}
