Even though it has more mass than the pebble, its size spreads that mass out, making it able to float. The pebble, however, has a small volume but a high mass for its size, giving it a density greater than water. Since objects with a higher density than water sink, the pebble went straight down. It all comes down to how mass, volume, and density interact with water."}
