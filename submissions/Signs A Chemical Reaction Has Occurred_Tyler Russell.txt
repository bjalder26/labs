{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Tyler Russell","observations1":"Bubbles formed after mixing vinegar and sodium bicarbinate. Flame went out immediately on splint test. No color change. No noticeable temperature change","observations2":"Bubbles formed after mixing hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide. Color changed to dark yellow color. Splint went brighter when put into test tube. No noticeable temperature change.","observations3":"Solution bubbled slightly when magnesium added. Solution also got hotter. Pop when splint added. No color change.","observations4":"No bubbles. Litmus paper went from red to blue. Bottom of test tube hot due to bunson burner. Smell of ammonia.","observations6":"Color changed slowly from blue to clear. ","observationsEthanol":"Only top of test tube got hot. Visible flames. Condensation on test tube.","observationsMagnesium":"Once lit, magnesium got hot and emitted a very bright white light. Ashy residue in watch glass.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":""}
