{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Olivia Cole","observations1":"the vinegar reacted with baking soda causing bubbles to form and pressure when the top of the test tube was covered; the fire went out","observations2":"the color of the hydrogen peroxide changed when potassium iodide was added. the flame didn't go all the way out and condensation formed","observations3":"hydrochloric acid reacted with magnesium ribbon causing bubbles, when fire was added creating a pop sound and forming a hydrogen ","observations4":"","observations6":"the color of the zinc changes from silver to almost black. the liquid (copper (II) chlorine) also became cloudy due to the particles from the zinc","observationsEthanol":"condensation formed therefore we created a gas due to the ignition of the alcohol forming a flame. the ice also melted because the fire was hot","observationsMagnesium":"the magnesium caught on fire when placed over the bunsen burner which caused a very bright light as well as smoke and ash to form. the color of the magnesium changed from silver to white.","GasTT1":"","GasTT2":"","GasTT3":"","GasTT4":"","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":""}
