{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Olivia Cole","observations1":"the vinegar reacted with baking soda causing bubbles to form and pressure when the top of the test tube was covered; the fire went out","observations2":"the color of the hydrogen peroxide changed when potassium iodide was added. the flame didn't go all the way out and condensation formed; temp changed- got warmer","observations3":"hydrochloric acid reacted with magnesium ribbon causing bubbles, when fire was added creating a pop sound and forming a hydrogen gas; temp changed- got warmer","observations4":"when ammonium carbonate was place over the flame it smelled like cleaner, the litmus paper turned blue when placed near top of test tube","observations6":"the color of the zinc changes from silver to almost black. the liquid (copper (II) chlorine) also became cloudy due to the particles from the zinc","observationsEthanol":"condensation formed therefore we created a gas due to the ignition of the alcohol forming a flame. the ice also melted because the fire was hot","observationsMagnesium":"the magnesium caught on fire when placed over the bunsen burner which caused a very bright light as well as smoke and ash to form. the color of the magnesium changed from silver to white.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"","conclusion":"In the 1st test tube we determined the gas was carbon dioxide by how the flame when out. In test tube 2 we know the gas was oxygen since the flame did not completely go out due to the fact that fire thrives off of oxygen. In the 3rd test tube the reaction caused a hydrogen gas to form, we know this because HCl is made up of hydrogen and Chlorine. The 4th test tube was determined ammonia because of the ammonium carbonate that was used to perform the reaction, it also smelled like cleaner."}
