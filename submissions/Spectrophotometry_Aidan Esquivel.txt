Our graphs ran a linear slope, suggesting our mixtures and readings were accurate. \n2. Using the accurate initial readings, we were able to success fully deduce variables such as molarity and concentration.\n3 (Bonus). Our technique was without flaw. Even as our peers doubted our abilities, we persevered, and came out on top!","frequency":"5.710e14","colorA":"","identityA":"Calcium","colorB":"","identityB":"Copper(II)","colorC":"","identityC":"Potassium","colorD":"","identityD":"Sodium","colorE":"","identityE":"Strontium","colorUnknown":"Orange","colorUnknownCobalt":"Violet","identityUnknown":"Sodium and Potassium"}
