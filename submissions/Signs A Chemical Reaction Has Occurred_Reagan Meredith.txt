{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Reagan Meredith","observations1":"After adding the sodium bicarbonate to the vinegar, it formed bubbles. when lighting the wood splint and putting it into the test tube, it immediately made the bubbles stop. The middle of the test tube warmed up, but the bottom of the test tube stayed the same temperature.","observations2":"When adding the potassium iodine to the hydrogen peroxide, the liquid turned yellow. Then when the lit wood splint was added, the liquid turned orange and started fizzing a lot. The test tube got very hot, and there was lots of smoke. THe smell was also very bad.","observations3":"When the magnesium ribbon was added to the hydrochloric acid, it started fizzing. Then when the wood splint was added, there was a loud popping noise. He magnesium ribbon turned a white color, and tge test tube got very hot.","observations4":"When heated, the ammonium carbonate melted. Then we added the red litmus paper, the paper turned blue. It smelt bad.","observations6":"The CuCl2 turned cloudy green, and the Zinc turned black with particles falling off. ","observationsEthanol":"When the ethanol was lit, a flame was produced. It was bright, and then died down. My hand got hot. The test tube with ice in it produced condensation and started melting when held over the flame","observationsMagnesium":"It was very bright then lit, then it got dim, but then lit back up. Now it is a pile of mashes. It smells like smoke.","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"Test tube one has carbon dioxide because the fire went out and made bubbles. Test tube two has oxygen because the flame got brighter when put in tube. Test tube three has hydrogen in it because when we put the flame in it popped and then went out. Test tube four had ammonia because when the paper was inserted, it turned blue. "}
