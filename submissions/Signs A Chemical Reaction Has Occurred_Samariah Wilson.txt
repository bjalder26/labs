{"labName":"Signs A Chemical Reaction Has Occurred","userName":"Samariah Wilson","observations1":"Hen we put the fire in the vinegar and carbon mixture it caused the fire completely out. I believe it was carbon dioxide.","observations2":"When we put the fire into the peroxide and potassium mixture it relit and burned brighter. I believe it is oxygen.","observations3":"When we put the fire into our mixture it popped before we could put the fire into the test tube. It was a hydrogen gas. It was also warm.","observations4":"When we put it above the fire and then added litmus paper in it, the paper changed colors. The smell was ammonia.  ","observations6":"Once we added our mixture and shook it. It changed colors from green to black","observationsEthanol":"When we put the test tube in the fire, the outside just fogged up a little. The test tube was cold. ","observationsMagnesium":"When we put the magnesium into the fire it turned into a flashlight. ","GasTT1":"Carbon dioxide","GasTT2":"Oxygen","GasTT3":"Hydrogen","GasTT4":"Ammonia","GasEthanol":"Carbon dioxide","conclusion":"When we did our experiments , we observed and came to conclusions of what it was. We used the table to find out which was which. "}
