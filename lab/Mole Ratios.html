<h3>Introduction:</h3>
The reaction of copper wire with silver nitrate in aqueous solution provides an interesting display of chemistry in action—delicate silver crystals begin to grow on the wire surface, and the color of copper(II) ions gradually appears in solution. What relationships govern the relative quantities of reactants and products in this chemical reaction?
     <h3>Concepts:</h3>
     <ul>
     <li>Mole ratio</li>
     <li>Balanced chemical equation</li>
     <li>Stoichiometry</li>
     <li>Single replacement reaction</li>
      </ul>
<h3>Background:</h3>
     Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the numerical relationships and mathematical proportions of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. One of the most important lessons of stoichiometry is that the amounts of the reactants and products in a chemical reaction are related to one another on a mole basis. Chemical reactions are normally represented by balanced chemical equations. The coefficients in a balanced chemical equation summarize the relative number of moles of each reactant and product involved in the reaction. The ratios of these coefficients represent the mole ratios that govern the disappearance of reactants and appearance of products. Knowing the mole ratios in a balanced chemical equation is essential to solving stoichiometry problems. The reaction of copper metal with silver nitrate solution is a single replacement reaction, represented by the following unbalanced chemical equation. 
<div style="text-align: center;">
    a Cu(s) + b AgNO<sub>3</sub> (aq) &rarr; c Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (aq) + d Ag(s)
</div>
       <br>
The values of the coefficients a, b, c and d can be determined experimentally by measuring the mass of copper wire that reacts and the mass of metallic silver that is produced in the reaction. 
  <h3>Experiment Overview:</h3>
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the number of moles of reactants and products in the reaction of copper and silver nitrate and to calculate their mole ratio. The mole ratio relating the disappearance of copper and the formation of silver metal will be used to write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

        <h3>Materials:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Acetone, 125 mL, in a 250-mL beaker* (CuCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O)
          </li>
          <li>Copper wire, Cu, 25 cm </li>
          <li>Nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub> , 3 M, 3 drops </li>
          <li>Silver nitrate, AgNO<sub>3</sub> , 1.5 g </li>
          <li>Balance, centigram (0.01-g precision) </li>
          <li>Beakers, 50- and 100-mL </li>
          <li>	Erlenmeyer flask, 125-mL </li>
          <li>	Labeling or marking pen  </li>
          <li>	Spatula </li>
          <li>	Stirring rod  </li>
          <li>	Wash bottle and distilled or deionized water  </li>
          <li>Wooden splint  </li>
        </ul>
         *This is an acetone rinse beaker. It should be shared with several groups of students in the laboratory. Place the beaker in the hood or in a central location for ease of use.
        <h3>Safety Precautions:</h3>
Nitric acid is a corrosive liquid and a strong oxidizer. Silver nitrate is a corrosive solid and is toxic by ingestion; it will stain skin and clothes. Acetone is a flammable liquid; avoid contact with flames and other sources of ignition. Avoid contact of all chemicals with eyes, skin and clothing. Wear chemical splash goggles and chemical-resistant gloves and apron. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before leaving the laboratory. 
      </div>

        <h3>Procedure:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
Obtain a clean and dry 50-mL beaker. Zero (tare) the balance with the beaker, and carefully add 1.4–1.6 g of silver nitrate crystals to the beaker. Caution: Use a spatula to transfer the solid. Do not touch the silver nitrate and carefully clean up any silver nitrate spills in the balance area or on the bench top. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Measure and record the exact mass of silver nitrate in the data table. </li>
            <li>Fill the beaker to the 30-mL mark with distilled water, and stir the solution with a stirring rod until all of the solid has dissolved. Rinse the stirring rod with distilled water. </li>
          <li>Cut a 25-cm piece of copper wire, and loosely coil it into the shape shown in Figure 1. </li>  
          <li>Find the initial mass of the copper wire to the nearest 0.01 g, and record it in the data table.  </li>  
          <li>Use a wooden splint to suspend the copper wire in the silver nitrate solution, as shown in Figure 1. The copper wire should not be touching the bottom or sides of the beaker.  </li>

           </div>                                                                                                                               
          <li>Carefully add 3 drops of 3 M nitric acid to the beaker. Do not stir the solution.  </li>  
          <li>Allow the beaker to sit undisturbed on the lab bench for 15 minutes. Try not to jostle or shake the suspended copper wire in any way. </li>  
          <li>Observe the signs of chemical reaction occurring in the beaker, and record all observations in the data table.  </li>  
          <li>While the reaction is taking place, label a 100-mL beaker with your name and class/period number. Measure and record the mass of this beaker in the data table.  </li>  
          <li>After 15 minutes, gently lift the wooden splint to remove the copper wire from the solution.  </li>  
          <li>Holding the wire with the wooden splint, place the copper wire above the clean, 100-mL beaker. Rinse the wire with a steady stream of distilled water from the wash bottle. The silver crystals should easily fall off the wire into the beaker. Gently shake the wire, and rinse with water until no more silver adheres to the wire. Note: Use a total of about 40 mL of distilled water.  </li>  
          <li>When all of the silver has been removed, lift the copper wire out of the beaker, and place it in the acetone rinse beaker. The acetone will clean the wire surface and allow it to dry more quickly. </li>  
          <li>Remove the copper wire from the acetone rinse beaker, and allow it to air dry for 2–3 minutes.  </li>  
          <li>Measure and record the final mass of the copper wire. Note the appearance of the leftover wire, and record your observations in the data table.  </li>  
          <li>Examine the beaker containing the silver product. Most of the silver should have settled into a dense mass at the bottom of the beaker. Carefully decant the liquid into a waste flask to remove most of the water. Note: Try not to lose any of the solid in the process.  </li>  
          <li>Rinse the solid with 5–10 mL of distilled water from a wash bottle. Decant the rinse water into the waste flask as well.  </li>  
          <li>Repeat the rinsing/decanting cycle with a second portion of distilled water.  </li>  
          <li>Dispose of the waste solution as directed by your instructor.  </li>  
          <li>When all of the liquid has been decanted, place the labeled beaker containing the silver product in a secure location as directed by your instructor.  </li>  
          <li>Allow the solid to dry overnight.  </li>  
          <li>When the solid is dry, measure and record the final mass of the beaker plus silver solid product. </li> 
       </ol>

            Silver is a precious metal. The price of silver fluctuates daily as it is traded on the open market. Look up the current market value of silver in the financial section of the daily newspaper or on the Internet (e.g., www.kitco.com), and record the price. Note: The price of metals is usually quoted per Troy ounce, where 1 Troy ounce = 31.0 grams. 
Calculate the current market value of the silver produced in this experiment.
