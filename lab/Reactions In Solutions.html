Procedure:

Part A: Double displacement reactions

You will mix aqueous solutions in 4 different wells, and record your observations looking for color changes, precipitation (solids on the bottom or cloudiness), gas formation, and temperature change.

  Label your well plate as shown above.

2) For each reaction measure the temperature before and after adding the 2nd reactant. If the temperature change is more than 0.2°C, then record the temperature change in the table below.

3) Add 10-12 drops of sodium hydroxide and iron(III) chloride to well 1 and record your observations in the table below.

4) Add 10-12 drops of sodium chloride and silver nitrate to well 2 and record your observations in the table below.

5) Add 10-12 drops of sodium carbonate and nickel(II) nitrate to well 3 and record your observations in the table below.

6) Add 10-12 drops of sodium acetate and lead(II) nitrate to well 4 and record your observations in the table below.

7) Based on your observations, decide if there was no reaction, if a precipitate or gas was formed, or if the reaction was exothermic or endothermic. If the temperature change was greater than 0.2°C and positive, then indicate that the reaction was exothermic, if the temperature change was greater than 0.2°C and negative, then indicate that the reaction was endothermic.

Part B: Acid reactions

You will mix aqueous solutions with hydrochloric acid in 3 different test tubes, and record your observations looking for gas formation, and temperature change.

8) For each reaction measure the temperature before and after adding the 2nd reactant. If the temperature change is more than 0.2°C, then record the temperature change in the table below.

9) Add 10-12 drops of sodium carbonate and hydrochloric acid to well 5 and record your observations in the table below.

10) Add 10-12 drops of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid to well 6 and record your observations in the table below.

11) Add 10-12 drops of potassium iodide and hydrochloric acid to well 7 and record your observations in the table below.

12) Based on your observations, decide if there was no reaction, if a precipitate or gas was formed, or if the reaction was exothermic or endothermic. If the temperature change was greater than 0.2°C and positive, then indicate that the reaction was exothermic, if the temperature change was greater than 0.2°C and negative, then indicate that the reaction was endothermic.

Part C: Single displacement reactions with solid metals

You will add aqueous solutions to solid metals in 3 different test tubes, and record your observations looking for color change, gas formation, and temperature change.

13) For each reaction measure the temperature before and after adding the 2nd reactant. If the temperature change is more than 0.2°C, then record the temperature change in the table below.

14) Add 10-12 drops of iron and sulfuric acid to well 8 and record your observations in the table below.

15) Add 10-12 drops of calcium and hydrochloric acid to well 9 and record your observations in the table below.

16) Add 10-12 drops of iron and copper(II) sulfate to well 10 and record your observations in the table below.

17) Based on your observations, decide if there was no reaction, if a precipitate or gas was formed, or if the reaction was exothermic or endothermic. If the temperature change was greater than 0.2°C and positive, then indicate that the reaction was exothermic, if the temperature change was greater than 0.2°C and negative, then indicate that the reaction was endothermic.

  18) Compare your results to the solubility table and activity series and note any difference in your lab data from what you would expect based on the solubility table and activity series.





19) Empty your samples into your 400 mL beaker, pour your waste into the larger waste beaker.

20) Clean your test tubes and beakers using soap and brushes, then rinse them 3-7 times and leave them on paper towels to dry. Put everything else back where you found it.

21) Clean up any messes, and make sure the dropper bottles are capped before you leave.
