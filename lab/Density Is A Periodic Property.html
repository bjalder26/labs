      <h2>Discovering an Element</h2> 
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3> 
     
      <p>“With the periodic and atomic relations now shown to exist between all atoms and the properties of their elements, we see the possibility not only of noting the absence of some of them but even of determining...properties of these as yet unknown elements.”</p> 
      
      <p>Dmitri Mendeleev proposed the periodic law for the classification of elements in 1869–1871. After observing trends in the properties of elements when they were arranged in order of increasing atomic mass, Mendeleev made a startling prediction. He predicted the existence and properties of at least three undiscovered elements. Mendeleev saw what other scientists before him had missed—he saw what wasn’t there!</p>
      
      <h3>
        Concepts
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Periodic Law</li>
        <li>Density</li>
        <li>Group IV elements</li>
        <li>Period number</li>
      </ul>
     
      <h3>Background</h3> 
      <p>At the time Mendeleev proposed the periodic law, the foundation of the modern Periodic Table for the classification of elements, 63 elements were known. Their physical and chemical properties had been studied and their atomic masses measured. Mendeleev arranged the known elements in a calendar-like table of rows and columns in order of increasing atomic mass and repeating chemical properties. It is at this point, however, that Mendeleev made a giant leap of discovery—he suggested that there were some gaps or missing elements in the list of known elements.
        
      </p>
    
      <p>Among the Group IV elements in Mendeleev’s classification scheme, carbon appeared in the second row, followed by silicon in the third row. Both tin and lead shared similar chemical properties with carbon and silicon and were also known at this time. Because of their high atomic masses, however, these metals were placed in later rows of Mendeleev’s Group IV column of elements. In 1871, Mendeleev proposed that there existed an as-yet-unknown element beneath silicon in the Group IV elements. He named the missing element eka-silicon and predicted its physical properties (atomic mass, melting point, density and specific heat). In 1886, the element germanium was discovered by the German chemist Clemens Winkler. In his report of the discovery, Winkler stat- ed: “There can be no longer any doubt that the new element is no other than the eka-silicon prognosticated fifteen years ago by Mendeleev.”
        
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Within 15 years of Mendeleev’s prediction of the existence of missing elements, three of the elements had been discovered, their properties in excellent agreement with those predicted by Mendeleev. Is it possible to recreate some of the excitement that followed the prediction and discovery of Mendeleev’s missing elements?
      </p>
     <h3>Experiment Overview</h3> 
      <p>
        The purpose of this experiment is to measure mass and volume data for silicon, tin and lead; calculate their densities; and use these results to predict the density of germanium, Mendeleev’s “undiscovered” element in the Group IV family of elements. The volume of the elements will be measured by water displacement.
      </p>
      <h3>Materials</h3> 
      <ul> 

<li>Lead shot, Pb, 35–40 g </li> 
       <li>Silicon lumps, Si, 8–10 g </li> 
        <li>Tin shot, Sn, 25–30 g  </li>
        <li>Water </li>
        <li>Balance, centigram (0.01 g precision) </li>
        <li>Beakers, 50-mL</li>
        <li>3 Forceps or tongs </li>
        <li>Graduated cylinder, 25-mL </li>
        <li>Marking pencil or pen  </li>
        <li>Paper towels </li>
        </ul> 
      <h3>Safety Precautions</h3> 
      <p>Lead powder is extremely toxic by inhalation and ingestion; lead fume or dust is a possible carcinogen. Using lead shot should not present a powder or dust hazard. Do not work with lead powder. Silicon is flammable in powder form and is slightly toxic. Do not breathe or handle any fine silicon powder remaining on the bottom of the reagent bottle. Wear chemical splash goggles and chemical-resistant gloves and apron. Wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the laboratory.</p> 
      <h3>Procedures</h3> 
      <ol> 

<li>Label three 50-mL beakers or small containers Si (silicon), Sn (tin) and Pb (lead).</li> 

<li>Obtain approximately 8 g of silicon chunks in the appropriately labeled beaker. Measure the combined mass of the beaker plus solid to the nearest 0.01-g, and record the value in the data table. (Note: This value is the initial mass for sample 1.)</li> 
        <li>Fill a 25-mL graduated cylinder half-full with water. Measure the initial volume of water, and record the value to the nearest 0.1-mL in the data table.</li> 
        <li>Using forceps or tongs, carefully add about one-third of the silicon chunks to the graduated cylinder (enough to raise the water level in the cylinder by at least 1.0 mL). Add the solid slowly to avoid splashing or breaking the glass cylinder.</li> 
        <li>Measure and record the new (final) volume of water plus solid in the graduated cylinder.</li> 
        <li>Measure and record the combined mass of the labeled beaker and remaining solid in the data table. (Note: This value is the final mass for sample 1.)</li> 
        <li>Repeat steps 4–6 twice more with the remaining amount of solid in the beaker. Record all initial and final mass and volume data in the data table. There should be a total of three sets of mass and volume data (samples 1–3).</li> 
        <li>Empty the water from the graduated cylinder, and carefully pour the silicon chunks onto a paper towel and allow them to dry. Do not allow any of the solid to go down the drain.</li> 
        <li>Rinse the graduated cylinder with water to make sure that all of the solid has been removed.</li> 
        <li>Obtain approximately 25 g of tin shot in the appropriately labeled beaker. Measure the initial mass of the container plus solid to the nearest 0.01 g, and record the value in the data table.</li> 
        <li>Repeat steps 3–9 using tin. Record all initial and final mass and volume data in the data table.</li> 
        <li>Obtain approximately 35 g of lead shot in the appropriately labeled beaker. Measure the initial mass of the container plus solid to the nearest 0.01 g, and record the value in the data table.</li> 
        <li>Repeat steps 3–9 using lead. Record all initial and final mass and volume data in the data table.</li> 
        <li>Return the correctly labeled solids to your instructor for reuse.</li>
