      <h2>Discovering an Element</h2> 
      <br><br>
      <h3>Introduction</h3> 
      <br><br>
      <p>“With the periodic and atomic relations now shown to exist between all atoms and the properties of their elements, we see the possibility not only of noting the absence of some of them but even of determining...properties of these as yet unknown elements.”</p> 
      <br><br>
      <p>Dmitri Mendeleev proposed the periodic law for the classification of elements in 1869–1871. After observing trends in the properties of elements when they were arranged in order of increasing atomic mass, Mendeleev made a startling prediction. He predicted the existence and properties of at least three undiscovered elements. Mendeleev saw what other scientists before him had missed—he saw what wasn’t there!</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Background</h3> 
      <p>At the time Mendeleev proposed the periodic law, the foundation of the modern Periodic Table for the classification of elements, 63 elements were known. Their physical and chemical properties had been studied and their atomic masses measured. Mendeleev arranged the known elements in a calendar-like table of rows and columns in order of increasing atomic mass and repeating chemical properties. It is at this point, however, that Mendeleev made a giant leap of discovery—he suggested that there were some gaps or missing elements in the list of known elements.
        
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>Among the Group IV elements in Mendeleev’s classification scheme, carbon appeared in the second row, followed by silicon in the third row. Both tin and lead shared similar chemical properties with carbon and silicon and were also known at this time. Because of their high atomic masses, however, these metals were placed in later rows of Mendeleev’s Group IV column of elements. In 1871, Mendeleev proposed that there existed an as-yet-unknown element beneath silicon in the Group IV elements. He named the missing element eka-silicon and predicted its physical properties (atomic mass, melting point, density and specific heat). In 1886, the element germanium was discovered by the German chemist Clemens Winkler. In his report of the discovery, Winkler stat- ed: “There can be no longer any doubt that the new element is no other than the eka-silicon prognosticated fifteen years ago by Mendeleev.”
        
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        Within 15 years of Mendeleev’s prediction of the existence of missing elements, three of the elements had been discovered, their properties in excellent agreement with those predicted by Mendeleev. Is it possible to recreate some of the excitement that followed the prediction and discovery of Mendeleev’s missing elements?
