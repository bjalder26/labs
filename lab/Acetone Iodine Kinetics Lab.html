      <h3>Introduction</h3>
In this lab, we will apply the concepts of reaction rate, order of reaction and catalyst. Our example reaction is the iodination of
acetone catalyzed by hydrochloric acid.<br>
      $\ce{CH3C(=O)CH3 + I2 ->[HCl] CH3C(=O)CH2I + I- + H+}$<br>
      
      The reaction is <b>zero order with respect to iodine</b>. You will figure out the <b>order with respect to acetone and the order with respect to HCl, and the rate constant</b>. Then, you
      will predict which initial concentrations are necessary to make the reaction run for <b>exactly 3 minutes (180 s)</b>.<br>
We will figure out the reaction rate by visual observation of the iodine. Iodine in water is brownish-yellow, and all other species are
colorless. In the experiments, you will start a timer once iodine is added to the other substances in the reaction mixture, and
measure the time until the solution appear colorless. We will run the reaction at room temperature. Try not to warm up any of the
reactants or the reaction mixture with your hands or other sources of heat (e.g. sunlight near window).
      
<h3>Experimental design</h3>
<h4>Finding the rate</h4>
Usually, the reaction rate of a reaction changes over time as reactants are depleted. Also, the concentrations change over time. To
be able to "plug in" the rate and the concentrations into the rate law and determine the order of reactions, you would measure an
initial rate.<br>
<div class="noBreak">       
Today, we are measuring an average rate, but it turns out the rate stays constant over the course of the experiment. There are three
reasons for this:<br>
<ol>
  
      
<li>The HCl concentration does not change (catalyst)</li>
<li>The acetone concentration does not change significantly (in large excess over iodine)</li>
<li>The iodine concentration changes a lot, but it does not affect the rate (zero order in iodine)</li>
      </ol>
      </div><br>
To calculate the rate, we consider the time it took for the iodine to "fade", and the initial concentration of the iodine. For example,
if the initial iodine concentration is 0.001 mol /L, and it takes 180 s for the reaction mixture to become clear, the rate would be:<br>
      
      $rate = \frac{Δ[I_2]}{Δt} = \frac{1.0\;x\;10^{-2}M}{180s} = 5.6\;x\;10^{-5}M$<br>
      
      <h3>Varying concentrations to find the order</h3>
You will set up multiple reactions, varying the concentrations in the reaction mix. To quickly figure out the concentrations, it makes
sense to always keep the final volume the same (25 mL), and use the dilution law to figure out concentrations (or volumes you need
      to add to get the desired concentration). Here is the dilution law:<br>
      $c_{mix}V_{mix} = c_{stock}V_{stock}$<br>
If you want to know the (initial) concentration of a component in the reaction mixture, plug in the volume and concentration of the
stock solution. For example, if our 25 mL reaction mixture contains 5 mL iodine stock with an original concentration of 0.005 M,
we get:<br>
      $c_{mix} = c_{stock}\frac{V_{stock}}{V_{mix}} = 0.005M\left(\fract{5mL}{}\right)$<br>
If you want to know how much of the 4-M acetone stock solution you need to get 0.8 M in the reaction mixture, you solve for the
volume of stock solution:
Procedure
This is the procedure for measuring a single rate. You will run this procedure twice for each different reaction mixture. You can
figure out the concentrations of the mixture from the recipe (the volumes mixed) using equation 4 or this spreadsheet. Make sure

the volumes in your recipe always add up to 25 mL.
1. Mix water, acetone stock and hydrochloric acid stock in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer. The reaction can not proceed at this stage (no
iodine).
2. At your bench, add the correct amount of iodine stock (5 mL) to the mixture and start the timer.
3. For better visibility of the color change, pour the reaction mixture into a large test tube, and observe from the top, with a white
paper under the test tubes. Prepare a large test tube with 25 mL water and one with 0.5 mL iodine solution in 24.5 mL of water
for comparison (see picture below: the iodine solution labeled 1:10 looks like water in the side view, but has a faint brownish
tint in the top view).
4. Stop the timer once the solution is colorless. Record the time in your lab notebook and calculate the rate for your experiment
(like in equation 2).
5. Keep the test tube with water and the 1:10 mix for the remainder of the runs. Discard the reaction mix, rinse the 125 mL
Erlenmeyer and the large test tube and invert to dry so you can use them again for the next run
Determining the orders of reaction
The easiest way to find an order of reaction is to halve the concentration of the species you are interested in while keeping all other
concentrations the same. If the reaction time stays the same, it is zero order in the species whose concentration you changed. If the
reaction time doubles (the rate halves), it is first order. If the change is more extreme, it is a higher order than one. If you learned a
mathematical way of determining the reaction order in your lecture section, feel free to use that method. Because of experimental
errors, we don't expect the reaction order to come out exactly as 0, 1, or 2, and you should feel free to round your result as you
formulate the rate law.
To find out two orders of reaction (with respect to acetone and with respect to hydrochloric acid), you need three sets of
concentrations (see  data sheet). You will run each set in duplicate, so you end up running a total of six experiments.
We have aqueous stock solutions containing acetone (c = 4 M), hydrochloric acid (c = 1 M), and iodine (c = 0.005 M). For the first
set of concentrations, you will use 10 mL acetone solution, 5 mL water, and 5 mL hydrochloric acid (which is corrosive and should
be handled under the hood until diluted), giving a subtotal of 20 mL. Measure out 5 mL iodine solution in a graduated cylinder, and
start the reaction at your bench by adding the iodine to the other components in the Erlenmeyer. Record the time and repeat the
experiment once to check for consistency.

For the second set of concentrations, we are using half the volume of acetone, and for the third set of concentrations, we are using
half the volume of hydrochloric acid (compared to the first set). The volumes are given in the data sheet. Calculate the volume of
water you need. You should check your recipe before you make the reaction mixture. Make sure the volumes in your recipe always
add up to 25 mL.
Predicting the rate of reaction
Once you know the form of the rate law (i.e. all the orders of reaction), you can plug in all the concentrations and the measured rate
to calculate the rate constant. It should be the same for all of your trials (if the temperature is constant), so you can average it to
average out random errors. Once you have the rate constant, you can predict the rate (and the reaction time) for any set of
concentrations. We will have a contest to see who can get their reaction to end after exactly 2 minutes (120 s), or closest to that
time.
The contest will be done bench by bench. Once everyone has calculated the concentrations they want to use, and has prepared
their reaction mixture (minus the iodine), you can ask for the contest to start. Your instructor starts a countdown, and you will add
the iodine to the flask when the timer starts. Then, you will transfer your reaction mixture to a large test tube and place it in a test
tube rack in the front. A doc camera will project the image of the tubes on the screen, so everyone in the room can see. Whenever a
test tube turns colorless, we will record the time. The reaction completing closest to 120 s wins our appreciation for good
calculations and good experimental technique (with a bit of luck).

  <li>At a station: ice</li></ul></div>
       
    <h3>Background</h3>
A colligative property is when a solute affects a solution property like its freezing or boiling point, and the effect depends only on the amount of particles dissolved, 
  no matter which substance you use. In this lab we will investigate the effect of the different solutes on the freezing point of aqueous solutions.<br><br>
      
      You should observe that as the solute concentration increases the freezing point  T<sub>f</sub>(solution)
  decreases (the freezing point depression ΔT increases), and this can be described by the following equation:<br>
       $\huge{ΔT = -i⋅k_f⋅\frac{n_{solute}}{m_{solvent}}}$<br>
      $\large{where}$<br>
      $\large{i=Van't\;Hoff\;Factor}$<br>
      $\large{k_f=freezing\;point\;depression\;constant}$<br>
      $\large{n=moles\;solute}$<br>
      $\large{m=Kg\;solvent}$<br>
      $\large{and}$<br>
      $\large{ΔT=T_f(solution)}-T_f(pure\;solvent)$<br>
      The value of k<sub>f</sub> for the solvent water is 1860 °C g/mol, or 1.86 °C kg/mol. Check your units to decide which format is more convenient in this case.<br>
      
      <h3>Experimental Design Considerations</h3>
We are making the assumption that at the instance the ice melts the mixture of ice and water is at the freezing point. 
      There can be multiple reasons why this is wrong, and we will discuss this in our pre-lab discussion.<br>
      
      <h3>Part 1: Freezing point determination, pure water</h3>
      <ol>
        
      
<li>Obtain a temperature probe and turn it on. <!--Measure the mass of a clean, dry 100 mL beaker.--></li>
<li>Pour approximately 25 mL of DI water into the 100 mL beaker</li>
<li>Place temperature probe into pure water in beaker</li>
<li>Add around 20 mL of fresh crushed ice to a 50 mL beaker.</li>
<li>Quickly add the ice to the 100 mL beaker, gently swirl the temperature probe. Record the lowest temperature, and the temperature just as the last bit of ice melts.</li>
<li>Weigh the mass of the beaker with the water and melted ice (so now just water). Record to the precision of the instrument. Clean and dry the 100 mL beaker. <!--and record the empty mass to the precision of the instrument.--></li>
<li>Discard the water in the sink.</li>
 <li>In your further calculations, use the last recorded temperature (when you scoop out the last bits of ice) as the freezing point of water. The temperature probes are not calibrated, but are very good at measuring temperature differences. Don't be worried if the reading on your temperature probe is different from that of your neighbor, and don't swap temperature probes.</li>

Part 4: Try a different experimental strategy
With a partner, measure the freezing point of a solution of sodium chloride again, using a different experimental strategy based on
the calorimeters we built last semester. This method is a bit faster but requires more equipment (work with a calorimeter instead of
a beaker to minimize heat transfer, or use the minimum temperature in the calculation, quickly removing the remaining ice by
pouring the slush through a sieve). As you are going through the steps, reflect on the pros and cons of this and the orginal method.
1. Weigh approx 0.05 mol of sodium chloride (molar mass is 58.44 g/mol), record the exact mass, and transfer to calorimeter cup.
2. Add approximately 25 mL water from a 100 mL beaker.
3. Place temperature probe into the solution in the beaker and swirl and stir to dissolve the sodium chloride completely. Place the
calorimeter cup into the calorimeter.
4. Add around 20 mL of fresh crushed ice to the 50 mL beaker.
5. Quickly add the ice to the calorimeter cup, and gently stir with the temperature probe. Once the temperature stops decreasing
(make sure there is still ice present), record the temperature, remove the temperature probe, and pour the mixture through a
sieve into a dry 100 mL beaker. Discard the ice in the sieve.
6. Weigh the mass of the beaker with the sodium chloride solution. Record to the precision of the instrument. Clean and dry the
100 mL beaker and record the empty mass to the precision of the instrument. Then, calculate the mass of water (solvent) from
the available data.
7. Calculate the van't Hoff factor for sodium chloride and record your work in the lab summary.
