============== beginning part =================== 

The only thing that needs to be changed in the "beginning part" is the title, and header (both in red).  The title is what appears at the top of the tab in the browser.  The header (<h1>) will appear at the top of the webpage.

============== beginning part =================== 

 

============== middle part =================== 

The middle part is complicated.  Below are different bits of HTML code used to build the middle part. 

============== middle part =================== 

HTML Tables 

This is an example of a basic HTML table.  It starts with a <table> tag, and ends with a </table> tag. 

Each row starts with a <tr> tag, and ends with a </tr> tag. 

Each cell in the table begins with a <td> tag and ends with a </td> tag, unless you want them to be considered a "header", and then you use <th> and </th> and they get formatted a little differently. 

If you need a cell to span multiple columns or rows then you can use colspan or rowspan, but ask for help with that because the first time is confusing. 

<table> 

  <tr> 

    <th>Company</th> 

    <th>Contact</th> 

    <th>Country</th> 

  </tr> 

  <tr> 

    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td> 

    <td>Maria Anders</td> 

    <td>Germany</td> 

  </tr> 

  <tr> 

    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td> 

    <td>Francisco Chang</td> 

    <td>Mexico</td> 

  </tr> 

</table> 

 

HTML lists 

Ordered list (numbered list) 

<ol> 

<li>first item in the list</li> 

<li>second item in the list</li> 

</ol> 

 

Unordered list (bullet points) 

<ul> 

<li>first item in the list</li> 

<li>second item in the list</li> 

</ul> 

 

Superscript 

H<sup>+</sup> 

 

Subscript 

H<sub>2</sub>O 

 

Paragraphs 

<p>This is the first paragraph.  It is not very long.</p> 

<p>This is the second paragraph.  It is a little longer than the first paragraph.</p> 

 

Note that websites will automatically wrap text. 

 

Line Breaks 

To better control the space between text, you can use line breaks.<br><br><br> 

This would be on a new line, and you can use multiple line breaks to gain more space. 

 

Images 

<img src="nameofimage.jpg" height="40px" width="80px"> 

 

To "size" an image you typically either set a height or width.  You shouldn’t need to set both. 

 

Since I am using glitch.com, the images need to be uploaded to "Assets", and then the src (url) needs to be copied and pasted from there.  This is not normal for a website, but it makes it so the file doesn’t count against your storage space. 

 

Headers 

There are 6 header sizes.  A header will take up an entire line and be larger than the regular font.  <h1></h1> is the biggest header size. 

 

<h3>Safety:</h3> 

 

Numerical Data Input 

(this is an input students put their measurements into) 

<input type="number" step="any" class="num" id="massCylinderT1" name="massCylinderT1"> 

This will create an "input" cell for students to input a number for data collection.  The id and name need to be the SAME and unique (not the same as another id). 

 

Calculated Numerical Input and Feedback 

(this is an input students put the results of their calculations into) 

<input  type="number" step="any" class="calc num" id="massWaterT1"  name="massWaterT1" formula="${massCylinder&WaterT1}-${massCylinderT1})"  help="Mass of cylinder and water minus mass of cylinder for trial 1"><div class="feedback" id="massWaterT1FB" name=" massWaterT1FB "></div> 

 

The id and name need to be the SAME and unique.   

The formula is how the program will check to see if the students got the answer correct.  If you want it to pull numbers from another input, then put the id of that input inside of ${}.  You can also use regular numbers in the formula. 

help is what will be shown to students when they get a calculation wrong. 

There is a default range="5%" that will count answers as correct if they are within 5% of the correct value calculated by the website.  This could be changed by inserting something like range="5%" into the input tag. 

Each Calculated Numerical Input should be followed by a feedback div. The id and name need to match the Calculated Numerical Input id and name but end in "FB". 

You can also have TEXT input and feedback.  Just change the type to "text", and the "formula" to whatever text you want to be correct.  With text input you can also set multiple correct answers using "||" to mean "or".  E.g. formula="Na+||Na1+||Na+1". 

 

Open Ended Input 

<textarea class="text essay" id="conclusion" name="conclusion"></textarea> 

Any open ended questions will need a textarea for input.  They only need an id and name that are the SAME and unique. 

 

Drop down menus 

<select name="GasTT1" id="GasTT1" class="calc" formula="Carbon dioxide" help="Compare your results in table 3 to table 2."> 

<option value="">Choose a gas</option> 

<option value="Ammonia">Ammonia</option> 

<option value="Carbon dioxide">Carbon dioxide</option> 

<option value="Hydrogen">Hydrogen</option> 

<option value="Oxygen">Oxygen</option>			 

</select><div class="feedback" id="GasTT1FB" name="GasTT1FB"></div> 

The id and name need to be the SAME and unique. 

Notice that in this case the "formula" is just text of the correct answer. 

 

Chemical Symbols (mass number and/or charge) 

<input type="text" class="calc num symbol" id="s9" name="s9" formula="12C+" help="Type the mass number, the symbol, then the charge (with the number before a + or minus).  Do not put 0 for the charge, just leave the charge blank if there is no charge." /> 

 <div id="s9DIV"> 

The id and name need to be the SAME and unique. 

The formula is the unformatted text of the chemical symbol 

You must include a div with the same id, but with "DIV" on the end. 

Notice that the type is "text", and the class includes "symbol".  

 

LaTeX 

$\frac{1}{3}$  

LaTeX needs to be surrounded by dollar signs.  The mhChem bundle is usable, so \ce{} can be used for chemical equations and chemistry formatting, but again it needs to be surrounded by dollar signs. https://texdoc.org/serve/mhchem/0 

$\ce{H2O}$ = H2O 

 

Lookup Tables 

It is possible to have the program look up data from a table (e.g. match data in one column to return data from another column).  This is a bit complicated, let me know if you want to do that in a lab. 

 

Graphs 

Graphs are complicated.  Let me know if you want to make a graph from the student’s data.

The only thing that needs to be changed in the end part is the footer, which only shows if they print it.  This "end part" is for if you just want a grade submitted without any review on your part.

This is the end part if you want them to submit the url instead.  This will create a picture of the website that is uploaded to Canvas, and provide a link to their submission as well.

Setting up a lab in Canvas 

Settings 

Apps 

View App Configuration 

+App 

Fill out the form as follows: 

 

Submit 

Assignments 

+Assignment 

Make the assignment name the same as the file name in glitch, but with the ".html" removed. 

Set the Submission Type to "External Tool" 

Click on "Online Labs" (the name you gave the tool) in the list of tools, then click "Select" 

Make all other assignment settings as you want them then save and publish the assignment 

Note: To check if it works, you will need to publish the assignment, and be in student view 

 

Creating a New File in Glitch 

Url to access the code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/elfin-ten-marble 

 

Capitalize every word in the title and end it in ".html".  At some point I should get rid of the capitalization requirement, but I haven’t yet. 

 

Uploading Images to Glitch.com 

Click on "Assets" 

Click on "UPLOAD AN ASSET" 

Select your image, and click on "Open" 

Once it has uploaded Click the "Copy URL" button to copy the url, then past that url into the <img> tag. 

E.g. <img src="This is where you paste the url" height="40px">
