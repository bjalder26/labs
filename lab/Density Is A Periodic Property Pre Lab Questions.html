      <h2>Discovering an Element</h2>
      
      <h3>
        Read the lab you wil do this week and then answer the following questions.
      </h3>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
        “With the periodic and atomic relations now shown to exist between all
        atoms and the properties of their elements, we see the possibility not
        only of noting the absence of some of them but even of
        determining...properties of these as yet unknown elements.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Dmitri Mendeleev proposed the periodic law for the classification of
        elements in 1869–1871. After observing trends in the properties of
        elements when they were arranged in order of increasing atomic mass,
        Mendeleev made a startling prediction. He predicted the existence and
        properties of at least three undiscovered elements. Mendeleev saw what
        other scientists before him had missed—he saw what wasn’t there!
      </p>

      <h3>Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Periodic Law</li>
        <li>Density</li>
        <li>Group IV elements</li>
        <li>Period number</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        At the time Mendeleev proposed the periodic law, the foundation of the
        modern Periodic Table for the classification of elements, 63 elements
        were known. Their physical and chemical properties had been studied and
        their atomic masses measured. Mendeleev arranged the known elements in a
        calendar-like table of rows and columns in order of increasing atomic
        mass and repeating chemical properties. It is at this point, however,
        that Mendeleev made a giant leap of discovery—he suggested that there
        were some gaps or missing elements in the list of known elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the Group IV elements in Mendeleev’s classification scheme, carbon
        appeared in the second row, followed by silicon in the third row. Both
        tin and lead shared similar chemical properties with carbon and silicon
        and were also known at this time. Because of their high atomic masses,
        however, these metals were placed in later rows of Mendeleev’s Group IV
        column of elements. In 1871, Mendeleev proposed that there existed an
        as-yet-unknown element beneath silicon in the Group IV elements. He
        named the missing element eka-silicon and predicted its physical
        properties (atomic mass, melting point, density and specific heat). In
        1886, the element germanium was discovered by the German chemist Clemens
        Winkler. In his report of the discovery, Winkler stat- ed: “There can be
        no longer any doubt that the new element is no other than the
        eka-silicon prognosticated fifteen years ago by Mendeleev.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Within 15 years of Mendeleev’s prediction of the existence of missing
        elements, three of the elements had been discovered, their properties in
        excellent agreement with those predicted by Mendeleev. Is it possible to
        recreate some of the excitement that followed the prediction and
        discovery of Mendeleev’s missing elements?
      </p>
      
       <p>The terms heavy and light are commonly used in two different ways. We refer to weight
      when we say that an adult is heavier than a child. On the other hand, something else is 
        alluded to when we say that oak is heavier than balsa wood. A small shaving of oak would 
        obviously weigh less than a roomful of balsa wood, but oak is heavier in the sense that a 
        piece of given size weighs more than the same-size piece of balsa.</p>
                    <p>What we are actually comparing is the mass per unit
                      volume, that is, the&nbsp;<strong>density</strong>. In order to determine these 
                      densities, we might weigh a cubic centimeter of each type of wood. If the oak sample weighed 
                      0.71 g and the balsa 0.15 g, we could describe the density of oak as 0.71 g cm<sup>&ndash;3</sup>
                      and that of balsa as 0.15 g cm<sup>&ndash;3</sup>. (Note that the negative exponent 
                      in the units cubic centimeters indicates a reciprocal. Thus 1 cm<sup>&ndash;3</sup>&nbsp;= 1/cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and the units for our 
                      densities could be written as g/cm<sup>3</sup> or g cm<sup>&ndash;3</sup>. In each case the units are read as grams per cubic centimeter, the<span>&nbsp;</span><i>per</i><span>&nbsp;</span>indicating division.) We often abbreviate "cm<sup>3</sup>" as "cc", and 1 cm<sup>3</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>= 1 mL exactly by definition.</p>
                    <p>In general it is not necessary to weigh exactly 1 cm<sup>3</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>of a material in order to determine its density. We simply 
                      measure mass and<span>&nbsp;</span>volume<span>&nbsp;</span>and divide<span>&nbsp;</span>volume<span>&nbsp;</span>into mass:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> $\Huge Density=\frac{mass}{volume}$</p>
      
      <h3>Experiment Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this experiment is to measure mass and volume data for
        silicon, tin and lead; calculate their densities; and use these results
        to predict the density of germanium, Mendeleev’s “undiscovered” element
        in the Group IV family of elements. The volume of the elements will be
        measured by water displacement.
      </p>
      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead shot, Pb, 35–40 g</li>
        <li>Silicon lumps, Si, 8–10 g</li>
        <li>Tin shot, Sn, 25–30 g</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Balance, centigram (0.01 g precision)</li>
        <li>Beakers, 50-mL</li>
        <li>3 Forceps or tongs</li>
        <li>Graduated cylinder, 25-mL</li>
        <li>Marking pencil or pen</li>
        <li>Paper towels</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Safety Precautions</h3>
      <p>
        Lead powder is extremely toxic by inhalation and ingestion; lead fume or
        dust is a possible carcinogen. Using lead shot should not present a
        powder or dust hazard. Do not work with lead powder. Silicon is
        flammable in powder form and is slightly toxic. Do not breathe or handle
        any fine silicon powder remaining on the bottom of the reagent bottle.
        Wear chemical splash goggles and chemical-resistant gloves and apron.
        Wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the laboratory.
      </p>
      <h3>Procedures</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Label three 50-mL beakers or small containers Si (silicon), Sn (tin)
          and Pb (lead).
        </li>

        <li>
          Obtain approximately 8 g of silicon chunks in the appropriately
          labeled beaker. Measure the combined mass of the beaker plus solid to
          the nearest 0.01-g, and record the value in the data table. (Note:
          This value is the initial mass for sample 1.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill a 25-mL graduated cylinder half-full with water. Measure the
          initial volume of water, and record the value to the nearest 0.1-mL in
          the data table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using forceps or tongs, carefully add about one-third of the silicon
          chunks to the graduated cylinder (enough to raise the water level in
          the cylinder by at least 1.0 mL). Add the solid slowly to avoid
          splashing or breaking the glass cylinder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Measure and record the new (final) volume of water plus solid in the
          graduated cylinder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Measure and record the combined mass of the labeled beaker and
          remaining solid in the data table. (Note: This value is the final mass
          for sample 1.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat steps 4–6 twice more with the remaining amount of solid in the
          beaker. Record all initial and final mass and volume data in the data
          table. There should be a total of three sets of mass and volume data
          (samples 1–3).
        </li>
        <li>
          Empty the water from the graduated cylinder, and carefully pour the
          silicon chunks onto a paper towel and allow them to dry. Do not allow
          any of the solid to go down the drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rinse the graduated cylinder with water to make sure that all of the
          solid has been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Obtain approximately 25 g of tin shot in the appropriately labeled
          beaker. Measure the initial mass of the container plus solid to the
          nearest 0.01 g, and record the value in the data table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat steps 3–9 using tin. Record all initial and final mass and
          volume data in the data table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Obtain approximately 35 g of lead shot in the appropriately labeled
          beaker. Measure the initial mass of the container plus solid to the
          nearest 0.01 g, and record the value in the data table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat steps 3–9 using lead. Record all initial and final mass and
          volume data in the data table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the correctly labeled solids to your instructor for reuse.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Pre-Lab Questions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Use a calculator to find the density of a piece of aluminum whose mass is 37.42 g and which, when submerged, increases the water level in a graduated cylinder by 13.9 mL.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        One of the elements Mendeleev predicted was eka-aluminum, corresponding 
        to a gap in the fourth row or period of the Group IIIA elements, between aluminum and indium. 
        The density of aluminum (period 3) is 2.70, that of indium (period 5) 7.31 and that of thallium 
        (period 6) 11.85 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Make a graph of period number on the x-axis versus density on the y-axis 
        for each of these elements. To make the graph you'll enter the above information into the data table below 
        and the graph will automatically generate.
