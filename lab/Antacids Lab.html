<h3>Objectives:</h3>
In this exercise, two commercially available antacids are evaluated and compared by:
<ul>
  <li>Determining the number of moles of  H+ neutralized per gram of each antacid.</li>
  <li>Calculating the cost effectiveness of each antacid.</li>
</ul>
 <h3>Background:</h3>     
Acid indigestion is a common ailment caused by the overproduction of stomach acid (HCl).
      Over-the-counter antacids provide some relief from the symptoms of acid indigestion. They are generally made up of some mixture of weak bases 
      such as $\ce{Mg(OH)2}$,  $\ce{Al(OH)3}$, and $\ce{CaCO3}$
  that can react with HCl as shown in these net ionic equations:<br>
<div class="center">      
$\ce{H+(aq) + OH^{−}(aq)⟶H2O(l)}$ (1)<br>
$\ce{2H+(aq) + CO2^{3-}(aq)⟶H2O(l) + CO2(g)}$ (2)<br>
</div>
      
In this exercise, titration will be used to determine the number of moles of H<sup>+</sup> neutralized per gram of antacid. 
      In the “back-titration,” a portion of antacid will be mixed with an excess of HCl. The  H<sup>+</sup>
  that has not reacted with the antacid is then titrated with standardized NaOH
  in the presence of the indicator bromophenol blue to a blue end point.<br>

The end point, is defined as the volume of  OH<sup>-</sup>
  needed to see a color change. Because only the tiniest excess of OH<sup>-</sup> over H<sup>+</sup>
  can cause the color change of an indicator, the end point is a close approximation of the equivalence point. 
      (The difference between the end point and the equivalence point is known as the titration error.) At the equivalence point, 
      the number of moles of  OH<sup>-</sup> added is equal to the number of moles of excess H<sup>+</sup>
  that had not been neutralized by the antacid. By knowing the total moles of  HCl
  added, one can then calculate the number of moles of H<sup>+</sup> neutralized by the antacid.

Total moles of H+=moles of H+neutralized by antacid + moles of H+neutralized by NaOH(9.3)
Because the antacid includes both  OH−
  and  CO2−3
 , it is not possible to calculate the number of moles of each of these ion species independently. Instead, the number of  H+
  neutralized by the antacid is found. The amount of antacid required to neutralize one mole of  H+
  neutralized is said to be one “equivalent.”

total equivalent of antacid=total mole of H+neutralized(9.4)
The more cost effective antacid is the one that costs fewer dollars per equivalent.

  
     
      

    
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
In this lab, we will apply the concepts of reaction rate, order of reaction and catalyst. Our example reaction is the iodination of
acetone catalyzed by hydrochloric acid.<br><br>
      $\LARGE{\ce{CH3C(=O)CH3 + I2 ->[HCl] CH3C(=O)CH2I + I- + H+}}$<br><br>
      
      The reaction is <b>zero order with respect to iodine</b>. You will figure out the <b>order with respect to acetone and the order with respect to HCl, and the rate constant</b>.
      <!-- Then, you will predict which initial concentrations are necessary to make the reaction run for <b>exactly 3 minutes (180 s)</b>.--><br><br>
We will figure out the reaction rate by visual observation of the iodine. Iodine in water is brownish-yellow, and all other species are
colorless. In the experiments, you will start a timer once iodine is added to the other substances in the reaction mixture, and
measure the time until the solution appear colorless. We will run the reaction at room temperature. Try not to warm up any of the
reactants or the reaction mixture with your hands or other sources of heat (e.g. sunlight near window).
      
<h3>Experimental design</h3>
<h4>Finding the rate</h4>
Usually, the reaction rate of a reaction changes over time as reactants are depleted. Also, the concentrations change over time. To
be able to "plug in" the rate and the concentrations into the rate law and determine the order of reactions, you would measure an
initial rate.<br><br>
<div class="noBreak">       
Today, we are measuring an average rate, but it turns out the rate stays constant over the course of the experiment. There are three
reasons for this:<br>
<ol>
  
      
<li>The HCl concentration does not change (catalyst)</li>
<li>The acetone concentration does not change significantly (in large excess over iodine)</li>
<li>The iodine concentration changes a lot, but it does not affect the rate (zero order in iodine)</li>
      </ol>
      </div><br>
To calculate the rate, we consider the time it took for the iodine to "fade", and the initial concentration of the iodine. For example,
if the initial iodine concentration is 0.001 mol /L, and it takes 180 s for the reaction mixture to become clear, the rate would be:<br><br>
      
      $\LARGE{rate = \frac{Δ[I_2]}{Δt} = \frac{1.0\;x\;10^{-2}M}{180s} = 5.6\;x\;10^{-5}\frac{M}{s}}$<br><br>
      
      <h3>Varying concentrations to find the order</h3>
You will set up multiple reactions, varying the concentrations in the reaction mix. To quickly figure out the concentrations, it makes
sense to always keep the final volume the same (25 mL), and use the dilution law to figure out concentrations (or volumes you need
      to add to get the desired concentration). Here is the dilution law:<br>
      $\LARGE{c_{mix}V_{mix} = c_{stock}V_{stock}}$<br><br>
If you want to know the (initial) concentration of a component in the reaction mixture, plug in the volume and concentration of the
stock solution. For example, if our 25 mL reaction mixture contains 5 mL iodine stock with an original concentration of 0.005 M,
we get:<br><br>
      $\LARGE{c_{mix} = c_{stock}\frac{V_{stock}}{V_{mix}} = 0.005M\left(\frac{5mL}{25mL}\right)}$<br><br>
If you want to know how much of the 4-M acetone stock solution you need to get 0.8 M in the reaction mixture, you solve for the
volume of stock solution:<br><br>
      $\LARGE{V_{stock} = V_{mix}\frac{c_{mix}}{c_{stock}} = 25mL\left(\frac{0.8M}{4M}\right)}$<br><br>

      <h3>Procedure</h3>
This is the procedure for measuring a single rate. You will run this procedure twice for each different reaction mixture. You can
figure out the concentrations of the mixture from the recipe (the volumes mixed) using equation 4 or this spreadsheet. Make sure the volumes in your recipe always add up to 25 mL.<br>

For each experiment (#1-3) you will use different volumes of acetone and HCl, thus will have different concentrations of acetone and HCl.
By only changing the concentration of one reactant at a time, we can see how that reactant's concentration affects the reaction rate.
To simplify calculations, each experiment should have 25 mL of total volume.
Calculate the mL of water you need to add to each experiment to ensure a volume of 25 mL and enter them in table 1.

Prepare a large test tube with 25 mL water and one with 2.5 mL iodine solution in 22.5 mL of water
for comparison (see picture below: the iodine solution labeled 1:10 looks like water in the side view, but has a faint brownish
tint in the top view).<br>
Keep the test tube with water and the 1:10 mix until you have completed all of the trials for comparison.<br>
      
<img alt="Image of water, iodine, and 1:10 mixtures in test tubes" width="460" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/4375f707-3207-40fe-9935-96f60406c3c1/iodine%20visible.PNG?v=1717481833134">
      
<ol>

For each experiment, you will do two trials, then average the time.  Follow the steps below for each trial, using the volumes in table 1.
  
<li>Mix water, acetone stock and hydrochloric acid stock in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The reaction can not proceed at this stage (no
iodine).</li>
<li>At your bench, add the correct amount of iodine stock (5 mL) to the mixture and start the timer.</li>
<li>For better visibility of the color change, pour the reaction mixture into a large test tube, and observe from the top, with a white
paper under the test tubes. </li>
  <li>Stop the timer once the solution is <b>colorless</b>. Record the time in table 1 and in table 2 you will calculate the rate for your experiment based on the time
(like in equation 2).</li>
<li> Discard the reaction mix (not the water and 1:10 mix), rinse the 125 mL
Erlenmeyer flask and the large test tube and invert to dry so you can use them again for the next run (or use new clean ones)</li>
</ol>

      <h3>Determining the orders of reaction</h3>
The easiest way to find an order of reaction is to halve the concentration of the species you are interested in while keeping all other
concentrations the same. If the reaction time stays the same, it is zero order in the species whose concentration you changed. If the
reaction time doubles (the rate halves), it is first order. If the change is more extreme, it is a higher order than one. If you learned a
mathematical way of determining the reaction order in your lecture section, feel free to use that method. Because of experimental
errors, we don't expect the reaction order to come out exactly as 0, 1, or 2, and you should feel free to round your result as you
formulate the rate law.<br><br>
To find out two orders of reaction (with respect to acetone and with respect to hydrochloric acid), you need three sets of
concentrations (see  data sheet). You will run each set twice, so you end up running a total of six trials.
We have aqueous stock solutions containing acetone (c = 4 M), hydrochloric acid (c = 1 M), and iodine (c = 0.005 M).<br><br>

Calculate the concentration of the acetone, HCl, and Iodine <b>after mixing</b> for each experiment using the formula below.  
      The mixture volume is 25 mL for each calculation.
      The stock solution concentrations are acetone (c = 4 M), hydrochloric acid (c = 1 M), and iodine (c = 0.005 M).
      The stock solution volumes are in table 1.
      Enter your calculated concentrations in table 2.<br><br>
      
$\LARGE{c_{mix} = c_{stock}\frac{V_{stock}}{V_{mix}} = 0.005M\left(\frac{5mL}{25mL}\right)}$<br><br>
      
      Calculate the rates of each experiment from your average times in table 1 using the formula below.  
      The change in iodine concentration is equal to the concentraiton after mixing.  Enter your calculated rates in table 2<br><br>
      
$\LARGE{ rate = \frac{Δ[I_2]}{Δt} }$<br><br>

Predicting the rate of reaction
Once you know the form of the rate law (i.e. all the orders of reaction), you can plug in all the concentrations and the measured rate
to calculate the rate constant. It should be the same for all of your trials (if the temperature is constant), so you can average it to
average out random errors. Once you have the rate constant, you can predict the rate (and the reaction time) for any set of
concentrations. We will have a contest to see who can get their reaction to end after exactly 2 minutes (120 s), or closest to that
time.
The contest will be done bench by bench. Once everyone has calculated the concentrations they want to use, and has prepared
their reaction mixture (minus the iodine), you can ask for the contest to start. Your instructor starts a countdown, and you will add
the iodine to the flask when the timer starts. Then, you will transfer your reaction mixture to a large test tube and place it in a test
tube rack in the front. A doc camera will project the image of the tubes on the screen, so everyone in the room can see. Whenever a
test tube turns colorless, we will record the time. The reaction completing closest to 120 s wins our appreciation for good
calculations and good experimental technique (with a bit of luck). -->
